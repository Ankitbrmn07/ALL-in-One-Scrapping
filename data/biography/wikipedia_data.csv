Tara Lipinski,"Tara Lipinski (born 1982) is an American former competitive figure skater, actress, sports commentator, and documentary film producer. A former competitor in women's singles, she was the 1998 Olympic champion, the 1997 world champion, a two-time Champions Series Final champion (1997–1998), and the 1997 U.S. national champion. Until 2019, she was the youngest single skater to win a U.S. Nationals and the youngest to become an Olympic and world champion. She was the first woman to complete a triple loop–triple loop combination, her signature jump element, in competition. Starting in 1997, Lipinski had a rivalry with fellow skater Michelle Kwan, which was played up by the American press, and culminated when Lipinski won the gold medal at the 1998 Olympics in Nagano. She retired from competitive figure skating in 1998. Lipinski became one of NBC's primary figure skating commentators in 2014, alongside sports commentator Terry Gannon and fellow figure skater and good friend Johnny Weir.
