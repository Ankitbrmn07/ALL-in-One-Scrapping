The FBI is acknowledging a new message tied to the disappearance of Today show host Savannah Guthrie's 84-year-old mother, Nancy Guthrie, who authorities believe was kidnapped from her Tuscon, Ariz., home last weekend.
""The FBI and Pima County Sheriff’s Department are aware of a new message regarding Nancy Guthrie,"" the Pima County Sheriff’s Department said in a statement to PEOPLE on Friday, Feb. 6.
""Investigators are actively inspecting the information provided in the message for its authenticity,"" the statement continued. ""While this is one new piece of information, the FBI and the Pima County Sheriff’s Department are still asking anyone with tips to contact the FBI at 1-800-CALL-FBI. The FBI continues to offer a reward of up to $50,000 for information leading to the recovery of Nancy Guthrie and/or the arrest and conviction of anyone involved in her disappearance.""
Tucson-based KOLD News/News 13 shared that it received the message earlier in the day. ""13 News received a new message this morning, February 6, regarding the Nancy Guthrie disappearance,"" News 13 stated.
""We are not releasing details out of respect to the family,"" the outlet added.
KOLD News/News 13 said it forwarded the message to law enforcement along with the IP address from the initial note. The IP address is not the same IP address as the initial note, but ""it appears the sender used the same type of secure server to hide their IP address,"" the outlet said.
""The new note contains information the senders seem to think will prove to investigators they’re the same people who sent the first note,"" News 13 stated.
On Friday afternoon, a large number of FBI personnel including Evidence Recovery Team and Forensics Team members, along with more than two dozen sheriffs showed up at Nancy's house, where they searched the back of the property, PEOPLE can confirm.
""We are back at the house again as part of customary investigation follow up,"" an FBI spokesperson tells PEOPLE. ""We were planning on getting back to the house today even before that message came in.""
Speaking about the large FBI presence at the property, he said, ""When the FBI is involved, we bring lots of resources.""
The Pima County Sheriff's Office said in a post on X that investigators were conducting a follow-up at the Guthrie home and in the surrounding area, and that the roadway in front of the home is currently restricted.
“Nobody on foot can pass the cones,"" a sergeant at the scene tells PEOPLE. ""We need everyone out right now. This is for further investigation.”

Nancy was reported missing on Sunday, Feb. 1, by her family when she failed to show up at church.
Law enforcement launched a massive investigation into Nancy's disappearance, saying they believe the grandmother was taken against her will, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said at a press conference on Tuesday, Feb. 3.
On Wednesday, Feb. 4, the Today show host, 54, her sister Annie, and her brother Camron made an emotional plea to the potential kidnapper in a video posted to Instagram, asking for the safe return of their mother.
""We need to know without a doubt that she is alive and that you have her,"" Savannah said in the video.
Nancy was last seen on Jan. 31 when her son-in-law, Tommaso Cioni, dropped her off at her house sometime around 9:48 p.m. after she had dinner with him and Annie at their nearby home, Nanos told The New York Times.
A trail of what appears to be blood was seen on the front steps of Nancy's home that authorities confirmed is hers.
On Wed., Feb. 4, Nanos said authorities believe Nancy is still alive.

Speculation about exactly what Nancy Guthrie did after she returned home on the night she vanished has mounted since the 84-year-old was reported missing over the weekend.
On Sat. Jan. 31 at 9:48 p.m., the 84-year-old mother of Today show host Savannah Guthrie, 54, returned to her Tucson, Ariz., home after having dinner with her daughter Annie and her husband at their house, Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos said at a press conference on Thursday, Feb. 5.
Her family dropped her off and that was apparently the last time anyone saw Nancy.
""At 9:50 p.m. that garage door closes, because [at] that time we assume that Nancy's home and probably going to bed,"" Nanos said at the press conference.
On Friday, Feb. 6, Nanos cleared up the confusion when he told PEOPLE, ""We know she had gone to bed.""
In a previous interview with NBC News, Nanos said, “When you’re taken from your bed and you don’t want to go somewhere, that’s an abduction.”
But Nanos “meant that figuratively and did not mean she was literally taken from her bed,” the sheriff’s department later clarified to NBC.
After Nancy went to bed, however, authorities aren't exactly sure what she did, Nanos told PEOPLE.
""Did she get up and answer the door?"" he says. ""Did she get up to go to the bathroom? Did she go to get something out of the refrigerator?
""I just know that this 84-year-old mom, grandma, went to bed that night and in the morning she was missing,"" he says.
Pima County Sheriff's Department
From what authorities have said, there was no activity at the house until 1:47 a.m., when Nancy's doorbell camera disconnected, he said at the press conference.
At 2:12 a.m., the software from the doorbell camera detected someone, but no video is available because there was no subscription, so investigators cannot tell who or what that was at this point. ""We just have no video, but we're not giving up on that,"" Nanos said at the press conference.
At 2:28 a.m., Nancy's pacemaker app indicated a disconnection from her phone. Nearly 40 minutes passed between the time the doorbell camera detected a person and the time Nancy's pacemaker app indicated a disconnect.
Nanos has said previously that he believes Nancy is alive.
Authorities, though, say they have no suspects at the moment.
They are looking into alleged ransom notes that were sent to various news outlets.
During the Feb. 5 press conference, FBI Phoenix Special Agent in Charge Heith Janke said one individual has been arrested for making a phony ransom demand.
Savannah and her siblings addressed their mother's possible abductors in a tearful plea video posted to Instagram on Wednesday, Feb. 4.

The notes included a dollar amount and two deadlines — the first at 5 p.m. on Thursday, Feb. 5 and a second for Monday, Feb. 9, if the initial demand was not met. He added that one note referenced an Apple Watch and another mentioned a floodlight, but provided ""no proof of life.""

Trade your basic black puffer for one of these colorful picks
Welcome to The Blueprint, where we break down the celebrity looks we want to wear right now and build them back up, piece by piece.
From Pamela Anderson’s peaceful existence on Vancouver Island to her minimalist beauty routine, there’s not much of her life I don’t want to copy — and my latest fangirl moment is fashion-related. 
Anderson wore an icy blue ensemble while filming her new movie Somedays, consisting of a baby blue puffer coat, a pale blue turtleneck top, and medium-wash straight-leg jeans. Her outfit expertly demonstrated how color can transform a typically bland one into a playful statement. That’s especially the case for her cozy coat, which I most often see in more mundane shades like black and navy. 
In fact, I figured out how to replicate her look with budget-friendly styles from Amazon’s fashion department — shop the three key staples you’ll need from $15.
Anderson’s frosty blue coat makes me want to roll my eyes at the sight of my boring black puffer hanging in my closet. On my hunt for whimsy, I was pleasantly surprised to find this similar style for under $35. I personally prefer slightly cropped silhouettes like this one because they don’t hide my curves behind heavy layers. Plus, the shortened hem doesn’t negate function. 
One customer noted that the coat is “incredibly lightweight yet surprisingly warm.” Other shoppers recommend sizing up one to accommodate for thick sweaters and hoodies. 
Straight-leg jeans are more comfortable than skinny jeans and still elongate your legs — a win-win. I gravitated towards these Levi’s because they have a slim silhouette and high waistline like Anderson’s. Buyers compliment the jeans’ soft material and comfortable fit. One shopper’s highest praise was: “The waist doesn’t gap, even when I’m squatting.”
In line with the monochromatic theme, Anderson’s character layered a muted blue turtleneck under her puffer. This cotton-blend option has a fitted (but not too tight) shape, foldover neckline, and ribbed hem. “The fabric feels soft against the skin but still has enough structure to hold its shape, and the knit is thick enough to be cozy without feeling bulky,” wrote a buyer.

Taylor Swift is wishing athletes good luck ahead of the 2026 Winter Olympics.
During the Milano Cortina Winter Olympics Opening Ceremony, the pop star made a cameo and shared a touching message with the athletes.
""I just wanted to say thank you!"" Swift, 36, said in pre-recorded video, wearing a Ralph Lauren Team U.S.A. Polo Bear Long Sleeve.
""Getting to learn your stories and see everything that you’ve sacrificed and all your determination and hard work and passion and everything that’s gotten you to this point where you’re so excellent at something, it’s just really inspiring,"" she continued.
""I am very grateful for everything you've done to get to this point in your life and grateful you brought us all along with you on this journey so that we get to watch you do this,"" the ""Fate of Ophelia"" singer concluded.
""I just hope that you have a wonderful Olympic games. Wishing you all the best of luck and a safe journey and I hope that this is an experience that you will cherish for the rest of your life.""
Swift's message to the athletes came hours after she dropped her star-studded music video for ""Opalite"" on Spotify and Apple Music.
The video begins as a satirical commercial for an ""Opalite"" spray that promises instant happiness — and turns into a cameo-packed love story around unconventional connections.
In an Instagram post, Swift said that the idea for the video ""crash landed into [her] imagination"" while promoting her 12th album on Graham Norton's talk show back in October 2025.
""I remember thinking I got ridiculously lucky with the group I was paired with,"" Swift explained, mentioning the group of actors and singers, which included Cillian Murphy, Domhnall Gleeson, Greta Lee, Jodie Turner-Smith and Lewis Capaldi, as people whose work she's ""admired from afar.""
She also thought it ""would be wild"" to include her fellow guests and Norton in the video, ""like a school group project, but for adults, and it isn’t mandatory.""
""To my delight, everyone from the show made the effort to time travel back to the 90’s with us and help with this video,"" the ""Cruel Summer"" singer wrote. ""You might even recognize some friendly faces from The Eras Tour ... I had more fun than I ever imagined - Made new friends, metaphors, and fashion choices. It was an absolute thrill to create this story and these characters.""

""Opalite"" was featured on her latest studio album Life of a Showgirl.

Vice President JD Vance was booed at the 2026 Milan Cortina Olympics opening ceremony on Friday, Feb. 6, at San Siro Stadium.
The Jumbotron showed the vice president and the second lady, Usha, as the crowd reacted to their presence. The pair was met with boos and whistles from the crowd. The crowd's reaction shifted to applause as Team U.S.A. was featured on the Jumbotron seconds later.
Vance, 41, Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Tilman Fertitta, the U.S. ambassador to Italy, are representing the U.S. on behalf of President Donald Trump at the international games. 
The reaction to Vance comes amid growing political tensions in the U.S., and the international reaction to the Trump administration’s immigration policies. 
A week before the Olympics, “sources at the U.S. Embassy in Rome” said that ICE agents would have a security role alongside other U.S. agencies present at the games, the Associated Press reported.
However, on Jan. 27, Milan Mayor Giuseppe Sala made it clear the ICE officers “are not welcome in Milan, without a doubt,” according to the BBC. ​ Additionally, on Jan. 31, hundreds of protesters demanded that ICE agents leave Italy. The protests continued on Friday, Feb. 6, ahead of the opening ceremony.
Chief of Security and Athlete Services for the U.S. Olympic & Paralympic Committee (USOPC), Nicole Deal said on Thursday, Feb 5: ""I can tell you unequivocally that there are no ICE agents that are part of the Team USA delegation on the ground here in Milan,” the Independent reported.
Sending agents from various federal agencies to bolster security for diplomats on the ground at the Olympics is not unusual, according to the AP. According to the news service, the U.S. previously sent agents from the Transportation Security Administration to the 2016 Summer Olympics.
The international protests follow the shooting deaths of U.S. citizens Alex Pretti, a local Minneapolis ICU nurse, and Renee Good, a mother of three, in Minneapolis.
Amid the ongoing political tension, Vance has reiterated that he was ""proud"" of how the Trump administration was conducting the ongoing immigration crackdown in Minneapolis.

Fitness influencer Sanne Vloet has revealed she experienced pregnancy loss.
""Pregnancy loss is never easy…. sharing this with an open heart <3,"" Vloet captioned the Instagram post shared on Friday, Feb. 6. In the post, the influencer shared a poem she wrote on Christmas Day of 2025, written after she learned that she was pregnant.
Titled ""The Test I Almost Didn't Take,"" the poem states, ""A friend asked if we were trying again. I laughed and said, 'Not really... but also not not trying.' It lingered in my mind all day. And suddenly, almost playfully, I thought: What if I just take a test? It felt ridiculous. Only two months after a miscarriage, what were the chances? When the result appeared, I froze. Two lines. The world went silent.""
The post continues, ""To my biggest surprise, and the most unexpected Christmas gift, I was pregnant again!! I felt an immense amount of joy and happiness, but the thing with experiencing a loss before is that it shapes you for any future pregnancy.""
""There is that quiet voice that whispers: What if? Don't celebrate too early. You never know. Still, I let myself hope: Maybe this was our rainbow baby!!"" the poem concludes.
The miscarriage marks Vloet's second in just four months. In October 2025, she shared that she experienced a ""silent"" miscarriage.
""Probably one of the hardest things I’ve ever gone through and shared,"" the influencer wrote in an Instagram caption from October. ""There are truly no words to describe how I feel… and no woman should ever have to experience this kind of loss. At our first scan at six weeks, we saw a tiny heartbeat, and everything looked promising. But right at eight weeks, I had a deep gut feeling that something wasn’t right.""

""Sadly, I was right,"" she wrote at the time, alongside video clips from her initial ultrasound. ""At our next scan, we discovered that the embryo had stopped growing, and my body went through a silent miscarriage. I’m sharing this because I know how common this is, yet how isolating it can feel. So many women go through this in silence, and if you’re one of them, I hope this reminds you that you’re not alone <3.""",fitness-influencer-sanne-vloet-announces-pregnancy,"""Pregnancy loss is never easy,"" the influencer began her post

The 2026 Winter Olympics are kicked off in Italy with a grand opening ceremony.
Hundreds of athletes from all over the world were welcomed by fans at San Siro Stadium in Milan, along with auxiliary ceremonies in the sister host cities of Cortina, Livigno and the other mountain towns where the 2026 Olympics take place this February.
The opening ceremony theme was of harmony, or ""armonia"" in Italian, highlighting the beauty of the Italian mountains and the chic city life of Milan.
Pop legend Mariah Carey performed at the start of the night, and Italian superstar Andrea Bocelli gave the final performance. Charlize Theron surprised the crowd with a message of ""peace,"" while The White Lotus star Sabrina Impacciatore led a lively dance number.
At the end of the night, for the first time, two Olympic cauldrons were lit simultaneously — one at the Arco della Pace in Milan and another in Piazza Dibona in Cortina.
PEOPLE's team of reporters is on the ground in Milan, and shared live updates from the opening ceremony. Follow along here.
The Olympic Cauldrons Are Officially Aflame!
After more than two months of travels from Greece to Italy, the Olympic torch finally finished its journey — but for the first time in Olympic history, it ended in two spots: Milan and Cortina. In each city, the final torch bearers lit cauldrons in the shared host locations.
In the mountain town of Cortina, former Italian alpine skier Gustav Thöni — who won gold at the 1972 Sapporo Games, handed the torch to Sofia Goggia, gold medalist in downhill at the 2018 Pyongchang Games, who lit the cauldron.
Over in the city of Milan, at the Arch of Peace, alpine skiers Deborah Compagnoni and Alberto Tomba — who both won three gold medals each for Italy in the late 80's and early 90's — turned the cauldron aflame.
Charlize Theron Makes Surprise Appearance at Opening Ceremony with a Plea for 'Peace'

While Mariah Carey and Andrea Bocelli were known entities at the 2026 opening ceremony, Charlize Theron surprised the crowd with a speech asking for ""peace"" in the world.
Theron, who is South African, said she was sharing her words for her ""beloved countryman,"" the late Nelson Mandela.
“Peace is not just the absence of conflict. Peace is the creation of an environment where all can flourish, regardless of race, color, creed, religion, gender, class, caste, or any other social markers of difference,"" Theron said. ""Today, this message seems more relevant than ever. So let these Games be more than just sport. Let them be a reminder of our common humanity, our respect for one another, and a resounding call for peace everywhere.”
Andrea Bocelli Sends Chills Through the Arena as Olympic Torch Is Passed for Final Time

Andrea Bocelli lit up the crowd — moments before the Olympic cauldron is officially lit. The 67-year-old Italian opera singer wowed spectators with his rendition of ""Nessun Dorma,"" the aria from Puccini’s opera Turandot.
The piece has become Bocelli's signature since the death of Luciano Pavarotti, his former mentor.
As he sang, the Olympic torch moved between a few of the final torch bearers, including Giuseppe Bergomi and Franco Baresi, former Italian soccer players for famed football club AC Milan.
NBC's Broadcast Goes on Without Savannah Guthrie as Search for Her Mother Continues

For the first time in years, Savannah Guthrie missed the Olympics opening ceremony, which she typically commentates live from the host city. PEOPLE confirmed on Feb. 3 that the Today host would no longer be a part of the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics coverage as her mother, Nancy, remains missing.
Mary Carillo instead joined Terry Gannon in Milan to conduct NBC's broadcast, along with former Olympian Shaun White. Earlier Friday, Carillo and Gannon sent their ""love and prayers"" to Guthrie, who is in Arizona during the search for her mother.
""We’re certainly without a very important and beloved member of our team tonight. She is dearly missed by everybody,"" Gannon said during the figure skating team event broadcast.
""She’s covered so many Olympics, and she loves it. Right now, of course, Savannah and her family are in unspeakable, unfathomable pain. We know that in the U.S., her extended family is legion. Savannah, my friend, it’s the same way here,"" Carillo added.
The White Lotus Comes to the Milan Winter Games
Italian actress Sabrina Impacciatore — who American audiences may recognize from season two of The White Lotus — was visited by the ghosts of Winter Games past in an energetic, stylistic song and dance number called “Time Travel.”

The segment included an animated video that represented 100 years of Winter Olympics with all the color and psychedelics of an LSD trip, which then transitioned into a live stage performance. Each era, from the ‘20s to the ‘90s, was brought to life via images, rhythm and movement, including two-dimensional cut-outs and fun costumes.
Team USA Enters the Stadium to Loud Cheers — And Seemingly a Hint of Boos
Lead by flag bearers Erin Jackson, a speedskater, and bobsledder and U.S. Army Sgt. Frank Del Duca, Team USA paraded into Milan's San Siro Stadium for the opening ceremony.
Outfitted in their Ralph Lauren toggle coats and hats, U.S. stars like hockey player Laila Edwards and figure skater Isabeau Levito proudly walked around the stage to massive cheers from the crowd, many of whom are American fans.
When the camera moved to Vice President JD Vance, who is attending the Olympics with pregnant wife Usha Vance and their three children, the crowd seemed to pick up a smattering of boos mixed in with the cheers.
Several of Team USA Figure Skating's Biggest Stars Are Skipping the Opening Ceremony. Here's Why
When Team USA's Olympic stars hit the stage at the opening ceremony, many of the biggest names will be missing from the Parade of Nations. That's because four of the U.S. figure skating stars have opted to skip the ceremony to get extra rest before their events.
Ilia Malinin, Madison Chock and Evan Bates and Amber Glenn will not walk out with the rest of the team, choosing instead to focus on rest and recovery, U.S. Figure Skating confirmed to PEOPLE.
Chock, 33, and Bates, 36, competed earlier in the day, placing first in the rhythm dance team event qualifiers, and are expected to skate the free dance on Saturday evening. That's also when Malinin, 21, is set to compete in the men’s short program, and Glenn, 26, will likely perform the free skate for the team event on Sunday, Feb. 8.
The Parade of Nations Begins — With a Twist
As with every Olympics opening ceremony, Greece — the home of the first-ever Games — kicks off the Parade of Nations, when the athletes enter the stadium. But due to the spread-out nature of these Olympics, which takes place in Milan, Cortina, Livigno, Bormio, Predazzo and Tessero, the athletes won't all be at the main opening ceremony in Milan.
Several of the performers who carried the names of each country on an ice block came into Milan's San Siro Stadium alone, as the broadcast flashed to the athletes walking down a runway in one of the satellite stadiums in Cortina or Livigno.
It was a peculiar moment in San Siro, as fans cheered for countries with no athletes entering the stadium. It wasn't until Armenia walked in that the first batch of athletes arrived — where they were likely excited to see that they would get actual seats, a rarity at opening ceremonies.
Vittoria Ceretti, Leonardo DiCaprio's Girlfriend, Presents the Italian Flag
Before Italian star Laura Pausini sang her country's national anthem, model Vittoria Ceretti walked Italy's flag down the stage to Sergio Mattarella, the president of Italy.
The 27-year-old, who dates Leonardo DiCaprio, led a group of women all in shiny, red, green and white suits — a nod to Italy's flag. The suits were designed by Giorgio Armani, who died in September. He created not just these suits, but many of the costumes worn by the opening ceremony performers and the outfits for the Italian Olympians.
Mariah Carey Hits the High Notes
Though the Olympics won't come to the U.S. for another two years, American star Mariah Carey came out during the opening ceremony to sing ""Volare"" in Italian.
The singer, 56, sparkled in a silver gown topped off with a feathered boa, with her blonde hair in tousled waves, and segued into her own song, ""Nothing Is Impossible.""
""Volare,"" known in Italy as ""Nel blu, dipinto di blu,"" was a major hit for Dean Martin in 1958, while ""Nothing Is Impossible"" is featured on Carey's latest record Here for It All, which came out in September.

Carey came out to enormous cheers from the Milan crowd, who hummed along and joyfully shouted when she hit the high notes.
Pizza Chefs, Moka Pots and the Leaning Tower of Pisa All Get the Stage
After a start filled with ancient statues in white, the opening ceremony quickly transformed into technicolor after enormous paint tubes dropped from the rafters, pouring down in cloth colors. With that, out came performers dressed in yellows, blues, reds and greens, who were shaped like different Italian inventions, from the moka pot to the Tower of Pisa.
The display is ""a grand parade of characters inspired by symbolic categories of iItalian imagination and creativity: Ancient Rome, cuisine, fashion, literature, the renaissance, architecture, design and the Venice Carnival as well,"" the commentators on Eurosport explained.
A Message to the World from Milan: Harmony
The word of the night in Italy is ""Armonia,"" or, in English, harmony. According to the official Olympics site, armonia is ""a deeply Italian value carrying a powerful and universal message of peace, unity and dialogue.""
The hope, said opening ceremony creative lead Mario Balich, is that the night will provoke emotional moments that will be remembered long after the Games end.
“It is about people, emotion and humanity. In a complex world, we want to offer a message of harmony, beauty and peace that can be understood by everyone.”
How to Watch the Opening Ceremony Live
This year, the opening ceremony kicks off at 8 p.m. Milan time, or 2 p.m. ET — helpful for Americans looking for something to watch during the Friday workday. The ceremony will air live on NBC and stream on Peacock, NBCOlympics.com, NBC.com, the NBC app and the NBC Sports app. NBC will run the broadcast again in primetime, at 8 p.m. ET.

The 2026 Winter Olympics opening ceremony wrapped up in Milan with a surprise appearance from none other than Charlize Theron.
The South African-born actress, 50, appeared in her official capacity as a peace ambassador for the United Nations to deliver a message of hope inspired by Nelson Mandela to the crowd at San Siro Stadium on Friday, Feb. 6.
“Athletes, spectators from every corner of the world, this is a message of peace by my beloved countryman Nelson Mandela,” she said. “Peace is not just the absence of conflict. Peace is the creation of an environment where all can flourish, regardless of race, color, creed, religion, gender, class, caste, or any other social markers of difference.”
She continued, “Today, this message seems more relevant than ever. So let these Games be more than just sport. Let them be a reminder of our common humanity, our respect for one another, and a resounding call for peace everywhere.”
Theron stood on stage near a dove symbol; opening ceremony protocol for Olympic Games calls for a symbolic release of doves after the Parade of Athletes and before the lighting of the Olympic cauldron. The Games stopped using real birds in 1992, and now just use the symbol.
In November, the UN Member States adopted the Olympic Truce Resolution for the 2026 Games, which ensures safe passage for athletes and officials to attend the Olympics and pushes the Games to promote and strengthen a culture of peace in their communities.
Theron — who lived in Milan for a year as a teenager — was not the only famous face to take the stage during the opening ceremony. Mariah Carey performed two songs earlier in the night, and Andrea Bocelli sang just before the actress appeared. The White Lotus star Sabrina Impacciatore also appeared in a segment that paid tribute to the history of the Winter Games.

Vittoria Ceretti brought a chic moment to the Winter Olympics in Milan.
The 27-year-old model, who is dating Leonardo DiCaprio, was among those who had the honor of serving as a flagbearer in the 2026 Olympic opening ceremony.
Ceretti, a native of Brescia, Italy, just 90 minutes away from Milan, handed off the Italian flag to the Italian Carabinieri’s honour guard, the Corazzieri, during the ceremony on Friday, Feb. 6 at the San Siro Stadium in Milan, Italy.
Ceretti, who has been linked romantically to DiCaprio, 51, for more than two years, appeared at the end of a long line of others in white, red and green suits representing the Italian flag.
The model wore a long, white, custom-made Armani Privé dress, according to Vogue Italia, with dramatic long sleeves and a high neck as she delivered the Italian flag shortly after pop legend Mariah Carey's performance.
Fans watching the ceremony were excited to see Ceretti during the Olympic ceremony in her home country. One viewer complimented the model's ""dreamlike refinement of beauty and elegance"" while others celebrated her ""mainstream turnaround"" following her relationship with DiCaprio.

Another noticed that broadcasters referenced Ceretti's relationship with DiCaprio during the ceremony, calling her boyfriend a ""very, very famous actor.""

Ceretti and DiCaprio have been linked for nearly three years. They were first spotted together in a video obtained by Page Six at the time, dancing together at a nightclub in Ibiza before sharing a kiss.
They were photographed together again in August 2024 during a trip to Italy with DiCaprio's close friend Tobey Maguire and others. While swimming in Sardinia, DiCaprio appeared to suffer a jellyfish sting, and in the photos, Ceretti seemed to come to his aid along with one of their yacht's crew members.
Ceretti joined DiCaprio at the Met Gala in May 2025, though the couple did not pose for photos together on the red carpet at the event. However, the actor could be seen in a photo obtained by Vogue, standing in the background and covering his face as Ceretti took center stage.
And in September, Ceretti stepped out to support DiCaprio at the premiere of his film One Battle After Another in Los Angeles, but once again skipped joining her beau on the red carpet.
In 2024, a source told PEOPLE DiCaprio ""seems to really like her"" and called her ""very cute, sweet and charming.""

Life in the NFL isn’t always as glamorous as it looks, and Natalie Lock is opening up about that reality. As the wife of Seattle Seahawks quarterback Drew Lock, the 29-year-old says the lifestyle can be exciting, but also “lonely” – especially while raising two young children.
Between constant travel, new cities and time spent away from extended family, Natalie has had to learn how to build community wherever football takes them. What’s helped most, she says, is the bond she’s formed with other NFL wives and girlfriends who truly understand the experience.
“I’ve met some truly supportive and incredible women through the NFL, and I’m so grateful for the friendships I’ve built over the years,” she tells PEOPLE exclusively.
Drew's NFL journey began in 2019 – the same year he and Natalie started dating. At the time, he was selected as a second-round pick by the Denver Broncos, where he spent the first stretch of his professional career. In 2022, he was traded to the Seattle Seahawks, marking the couple’s first move to the Pacific Northwest.
After two seasons in Seattle, Drew signed with the New York Giants for the 2024 season before returning to the Seahawks in 2025. With every move came new routines, new homes and new circles to build from scratch as rosters changed.
Now back in Seattle, Natalie says she’s found a strong support system – even if the lifestyle still comes with its challenges. 
“This lifestyle can feel lonely at times, so having people around who understand it without explanation makes a big difference,” she admits. “We’re always rooting for one another, and I really love that part of it. I’ve learned so much along the way from being surrounded by other NFL wives.”

As a mom to son Layton, born in 2024, and daughter Landry, born in 2025, those friendships have been especially meaningful during this busy season of life.
This year has been particularly special, as the Seahawks’ wives and girlfriends have grown even closer during an unforgettable season. Seattle’s run to Super Bowl LX brought the group together through watch parties, travel and shared nerves.
“I will say that the bond we have this year on the Seahawks has been one of my favorite things this season,” she shares. “We’ve made friends for life and I’m so grateful.”
The Seahawks are set to face the New England Patriots in Super Bowl LX on Sunday, Feb. 8, 2026, marking a major moment for the team and its fans.
For Natalie, it’s another reminder of how quickly things can change in the NFL – and how important it is to appreciate each moment as it comes.
“This lifestyle comes with a lot of uncertainty, which has taught me how important it is to just stay present,” she emphasizes. “I try to put the rest in God’s hands and trust that whatever happens is exactly how it’s meant to happen.”
When it comes to being married to an NFL quarterback, Natalie says she’s learned valuable lessons about discipline, resilience and consistency.
“It takes incredible discipline to compete at this level, and I’m fascinated by [Drew’s] work ethic and resilience,” Natalie tells PEOPLE. “It has made me want to be my best in everything I do. I’m so grateful our kids get to grow up seeing that example firsthand. He truly is a superhero in our kids' eyes and I love that.”",wife-of-seahawks-drew-lock-admits-lifestyle-can-be,"“I’ve learned so much along the way from being surrounded by other NFL wives,” Natalie Lock tells PEOPLE

A rescue mission for a man who fell through an icy lake got off to a very quick start thanks to the nearby location of a rescue team.
On Feb. 3 at Fish Lake in Chelan County, Wash., the King County Sheriff’s Office (KCSO) Marine Unit and the Mercer Island Police Dive squad were taking part in an annual diving and ice rescue training session when they witnessed the person fall into the ice.
“They were about to pack up and leave when they saw a fisherman, walking back to shore, fall through the ice,” a KCSO spokesperson told PEOPLE in a statement. “There were two people with him and the team says if they had tried to help all would have fallen through the ice.”
KCSO noted that the water and air temperature was about 35 degrees, adding that rescue personnel initially tried to use a rescue tube and then a rescue boogie board to save the man.  
“Three deputies reached him — they tried the rescue tube, but the ice was breaking all around them so they couldn’t get him onto the ice surface,” KCSO said.

The spokesperson continued, “They switched to the rescue boogie board — and then the rest of the team still on the dock was able to pull him onto the ice’s surface.”

Once rescued, the man was placed in a warm cabin, where an emergency medical technician assessed his health. 
“He was cold but okay and was able to drive home,” KCSO told PEOPLE, adding that a sergeant explained that “if they hadn’t been there and someone called 911 it likely would have taken the better part of an hour for emergency crews to arrive and plan for a rescue.”
Sgt. Rich Barton told local outlet KOMO News, “Right place, right time.”

Multiple people were rescued from the icy waters in Queens, New York, on Friday, Feb. 6.
Around 4:15 p.m., the Fire Department of New York was alerted of three people in the Jamaica Bay waters, near 13-10 Norton Dr. in Far Rockaway, PIX11 reports.
The three men, all 22, were walking across the frozen bay until they suddenly fell in. At the time of their fall, they had walked about the length of a football field on the ice. They were all submerged in ice water at approximately 36 degrees, according to Tideschart. 
As they were “panicking,” they were “screaming for help,” witness Thomas Castro told ABC 7. 
Another witness, Aiden Gabourel, said he was yelling back at them to “calm down.” as they screamed, “ ‘Help help help help.’ ”
FDNY first responders arrived first, and one of them fell into the water while trying to reach the victims. The FDNY crew member was able to pull himself out.
""The first guy that came out of the helicopter actually needed to rescue himself,"" Castro said. ""Because as soon as he went in the water his line that was supposed to attach himself with the guy he was rescuing, the line kinda detached itself.""
The New York Police Department later arrived, and an NYPD scuba team member also fell into the water. The NYPD's aviation unit rescued the men with a helicopter. 
After nearly 40 minutes in the water, one of the victims had stopped moving before he was safely pulled out. ""There was one in particular because I was zooming in with my phone and he looked like he was struggling more than the other ones,"" Gabourel said.
“And I could hear ‘em talking, 'Listen, just hold on, don't make any movements or whatever,' "" he said, adding, ""Yeah, I just thought about hypothermia.”
Each man was successfully rescued. One was taken to St. John's Episcopal Hospital in Far Rockaway, and the other two victims were transported to Mount Sinai South Nassau Hospital in Oceanside. All three are alert and conscious.
The victims’ neighbors said that the three men had been walking on the icy bay all week, despite advisement to stop. ""All the neighbors tell them to stop. They don't listen. They don't listen to nobody,"" Castro said, according to the New York Daily News.
“Luckily, it was warm and not a day like tomorrow where it’s going to feel like negative 20 degrees,” Castro said, according to the outlet.
""Every day I drive by, I live around the corner, I see them doing it and I pull over and say look that's not a good idea, you shouldn't do that,"" Gabourel said, per ABC 7.

A young girl and her 70-year-old grandfather were stabbed in an alleged carjacking in the San Fernando Valley area of Los Angeles on Friday, Feb. 6 while on their way to school.
Officers responded to the scene at 10300 block of Eldora Avenue just before 8 a.m. local time on Friday, KTLA reports, citing the Los Angeles Police Department. The victims were treated at the scene and brought to a nearby hospital, the outlet reports, citing the Los Angeles Fire Department.
The young girl was released from the hospital at 12 p.m. Friday, and the grandfather remains hospitalized after sustaining stab wounds to his neck — potentially hitting an artery, according to KTLA. The grandfather was last heard to be in stable condition, the outlet reports, citing LAPD.
ABC 7 obtained Ring camera footage from the scene, allegedly depicting the suspect, identified as Eric Avilez, attacking the people in the car. Neighbors told the outlet that Avilez had been causing a series of disturbances in the neighborhood while staying with family members next door to the victims.
""All kinds of crazy stuff,"" neighbor Mike Agajanyan told ABC 7. ""Just your worst nightmare as a neighbor. You don't want this in your neighborhood.""
The suspect's brother, Esteban Avilez, told ABC 7 the suspect ""has mental issues.""
The stabbing reportedly occurred when the pair were on their way to the young girl's school in the Sunland neighborhood, Fox 11 reports, citing LAPD. Residents in the neighborhood claimed they witnessed the suspect, allegedly a neighbor, run around the car and attempt to grab the girl. There were allegedly two other children in the car who made it to safety, the outlet reports, citing LAPD.

A Florida woman has reportedly been killed by her neighbor’s horses, the same animals she would regularly visit and feed. 
The incident happened just before 2 p.m. local time on Thursday, Feb. 5, in a field next to the Lucerne Lakeside Mobile Home Park, WFLA, Fox 13 Tampa Bay, and Tampa Free Press reported, citing the Winter Haven Police Department.
An identity for the victim had not yet been made public.
PEOPLE reached out to the Winter Haven Police Department and the Winter Haven medical examiner's office for comment, but did not immediately receive a response.
When first responders arrived at the scene, they found the woman unconscious and with visible injuries to her body consistent with being trampled by a large animal, such as a horse. 
Two horses were reportedly found within close proximity to her. 
Life-saving measures were performed by police, before Polk County EMS transported the woman to a local hospital, where she was later pronounced dead. 
""Our hearts go out to the family and friends of this beloved woman who cared so much to interact and feed these horses,"" Police Chief Vance Monroe said.

I’m a terrible sleeper. My brain doesn’t know how to shut off when I go to bed, and I’m lucky if I get one or two hours of sleep per night. 
Though drinking copious amounts of coffee helps me function, I recently learned that updating your sleep space can improve your shut-eye. So, I’m turning to Wayfair’s under-the-radar Sounder Sleep Shop for a little sleep aid. It’s filled with cozy comforters, cooling pillows, and snuggly quilts to help me—and you—get off to dreamland faster.
Below, you’ll find my top 10 upgrades from brands like Eddie Bauer and Laura Ashley, starting at just $14. 
Your bedroom should be your personal oasis, so I’m using this Eddie Bauer comforter and the included pillow shams to boost my room’s cozy factor. Featuring brushed micro-suede on one side and snuggly faux shearling on the other, this reversible find will go a long way toward helping me relax come bedtime and stay warm during the remaining six weeks of winter. Reviewers add that it’s the “perfect weight” and “fits great on [a] bed,” with another person sharing that it’s so warm, you won’t need another blanket underneath.
Since I normally don’t get enough of it, I know sleep is a luxury in more ways than one. These thermoregulating silk pillowcases might be enough to convince my overactive mind to settle down for the night. They’re made from super-soft Mulberry silk, which shoppers say helps prevent wrinkles and tame frizzy hair. Now that’s beauty sleep I can get behind. 
In addition to being a bad sleeper, I also run hot when I go to bed. These cooling sheets should help me on both fronts. Older shoppers say they’re a “game changer for hot flashes,” while others add that they “feel unbelievably soft and silky — almost like hotel luxury bedding,” thanks to their bamboo fabric. 
Lately, I've gotten into the habit of reading at night to quiet my brain and unwind before going to sleep. I do most of this reading in the armchair that sits in the corner of my bedroom, and I am already looking forward to wrapping myself in this throw blanket while curling up with my next novel. I’m drawn to its chunky, knitted texture. It’s hypoallergenic, making it a safe choice for me and others who have sensitive skin. Shoppers add that it has a “high-end look that instantly elevates” any space, and its generous size is suitable for draping over the end of your bed.

Around May 2017, Heather Wallace began noticing swelling in her neck that resembled a goiter – a visible enlargement of the thyroid gland.
Concerned by its rapid growth and the development of a persistent cough, she went to see an endocrinologist in April 2018.
At the appointment, the doctor ran standard thyroid tests that measured both thyroxine (T4) and the thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) to determine whether her thyroid was functioning properly.
When those results came back “normal,” the mother of three pushed for more thorough testing, but her request was ultimately dismissed for years. “I knew there was something deeper going on, but [the doctor] never listened to me or my concerns,” Wallace, 40, tells PEOPLE exclusively.
As the goiter continued to grow, Wallace slowly began to realize how much it was shaping her everyday life in ways she hadn’t initially connected.
Activities she once took for granted – long walks, keeping up with her children, even basic movement – left her unusually winded. At the time, she assumed she was simply out of shape, not recognizing that the strain on her body had been building for years.
“Some days I would truthfully just forget that I had a giant goiter in my neck because my body didn’t feel inflamed or bothered,” Wallace admits. “But there were other days when I would be in a flare, and my throat would feel so thick and large.”

Living with a visibly enlarged neck also meant navigating constant public attention. Strangers stared, and while Wallace understood that her case was unusual, the awareness never stopped weighing on her.
The attention became more painful when online comments turned into mockery, with people calling her “frog throat girl” and comparing her to a bullfrog.
“My mental health was definitely affected,” Wallace reveals, adding that the emotional toll often brought on bouts of depression. “I had such negative views about my looks, I felt so ugly.”
With a combination of persistent symptoms, unanswered questions and changes to her appearance, Wallace tells PEOPLE it all started to eat away at her self-esteem. “After years of trying to figure out the reason for my goiter with no avail… I felt so defeated,” she says. 
Eventually, after getting the opinion of yet another doctor, surgery became unavoidable. In December 2025, Wallace went into the operating room expecting a hemithyroidectomy, or thyroid lobectomy, believing only her right thyroid lobe would be removed. She was “heartbroken” to later learn they had to remove the entire gland.
“It was such a disappointment,” she admits. “When I woke up and found out I had lost my entire thyroid, I was so very sad.”
That sense of grief quickly turned into anger when she learned that a later biopsy of her thyroid showed signs of undiagnosed Hashimoto’s disease, an autoimmune disorder in which ""immune-system cells lead to the death of the thyroid's hormone-producing cells,"" per the Mayo Clinic.
“I had spent years seeing doctors and never once did any of them test for Hashimoto’s until now,” Wallace shares. “I just wish I would have known this from the start so I could have taken care of myself in ways I didn’t know I should have because I didn’t know I had autoimmune issues until it was too late.”
Two months after the surgery, Wallace says life without a thyroid has stabilized. Medication adjustments have helped ease the side effects of an initially high hormone dose, and her body is responding well.
Emotionally, the process has been more complicated. She is still working through the weight of losing a vital organ and relying on daily medication to survive.
Over time, however, her relationship with her body has shifted in a surprising way. Without the goiter, Wallace says she feels more at home in her own skin than she has in nearly a decade.
“Once I got [the goiter] removed, I was finally able to wear necklaces again after eight years, I finally had a stronger jawline again, and I can hug my family without my neck getting squished between us,” she explains. “I think finally looking like the woman I was when I married my husband 10 years ago has really helped rebuild my confidence.”
Today, Wallace hopes her experience encourages others to trust themselves when something in their body feels off.
“Advocate for yourself,” she warns – urging patients to ask questions, seek support and push for thorough testing.
For those living with visible medical conditions, she emphasizes that judgment does not define worth.
“You have a purpose in this life and you can change so many people's lives because of the issues you have to face on a daily basis,” Wallace tells PEOPLE. “Let your heart shine brighter than the dark world around you.”",doctor-dismissed-40-year-olds-‘frog-throat’-for-ye,"“I knew there was something deeper going on but [the doctor] never listened to me or my concerns,” Heather Wallace tells PEOPLE

""When lip fillers started getting popular 15 years ago, I think it was about getting bigger lips, and you want more and more, but I think it just does make you look older,"" she said. ""I used to get my lips done nearly every month, and because you're seeing it every day, it's like an addiction, and then it migrates to other areas of the face. It's not what I recommend.""

Another cause of concern, according to Jerrard? Tanning.
""I used to really be into tanning when I was younger, and I was always told how bad they were, but in the past five years, I've noticed the texture of my skin not looking as good as it used to,"" she explained.
After trying ""loads of things,"" including ""micro-needling,"" Jerrard said, ""I've been putting more of my investment in skin care in facials, and that's been great. It is something that I want to maintain.""
And when it comes to one specific product that has been her saving grace, Jerrard credits a ""Tretinoin prescription cream.""
""It's made a huge difference,"" she said.","woman-in-her-40s,-who-says-shes-often-mistaken-for","""People are often saying they can't believe [my age], and they think I'm 10 or 15 years younger,"" Jessica Jerrard said

The mother of a 20-year-old Syracuse University student, who allegedly died after being trapped in his burning Tesla when it crashed last October, has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against the electric car maker. 
In the complaint filed in U.S. District Court in Massachusetts on Wednesday, Feb. 4, Samuel Tremblett’s mother, Jacquelyn Tremblett, alleged that Tesla designed and manufactured a “defective” 2021 Model Y vehicle that, following a collision, erupted in flames and trapped her son inside, “where he sustained catastrophic thermal injuries, smoke inhalation, causing his death.” 
According to the court document, which PEOPLE obtained, Tremblett’s mother alleges that Tremblett was driving the Model Y on Oct. 29 at around 1 a.m. local time on the northbound lane of Turnpike Street in Easton, Mass. After entering Easton, the vehicle left its lane of travel, crossed the southbound lane and crashed into a tree. The complaint added that Tremblett survived the collision. 

Immediately after the Model Y struck the tree, the complaint claims, the vehicle erupted in flames. The family alleged that due to the “defective and unreasonably dangerous electronic system for operating the door handles,” which the suit said Tesla designed, built and sold, Tremblett was unable to escape from the burning car.

The complaint mentioned an alleged 911 call Tremblett placed with a dispatcher, explaining that he was trapped in the Model Y. 
“I can’t breathe .. it’s on fire. Help please ... I am going to die,” Tremblett said, the complaint alleges. “I’m dying ... Help ... Help.’’
Police immediately arrived at the scene but were unable to extinguish the fire or remove Tremblett from the car, the complaint read. Officers said they heard four explosions in the first 10 minutes of being on the scene, per allegations in the complaint, which claimed that it took four hours for authorities to finally put out the flames. 
“Unable to open the doors, Mr. Tremblett was trapped in the Tesla vehicle and died from thermal injuries and smoke inhalation before he was rescued,” the complaint claims
The suit also mentioned at least 15 alleged incidents since 2016, in which people have died after being trapped in Tesla vehicles by the electric doors. 
“Notwithstanding the advice of Tesla’s engineers that this design was a serious safety hazard,” the complaint alleges, “Mr. [Elon] Musk [Tesla founder] refused to approve a safe, alternative design.”
“Tesla continues to manufacture and sell its vehicles with the defective and unreasonably dangerous automated door handles,” the complaint further alleged.
Among the claims by Tremblett’s family in their lawsuit against Tesla are negligence, breach of warranty, wrongful death and conscious pain and suffering. 
An obituary said Tremblett was born in Middleborough, Mass., and attended Syracuse University for three years, majoring in design studies. 
“Samuel was full of life and energy,” the tribute read. “He loved spending time with his younger brother, Tristan, whether shooting hoops, hanging out with friends, or just enjoying each other's company. 
“He was an entrepreneur who had a vision to design his own clothes and in 2024 launched his own clothing line, Forget Raven, which became an instant success, and he was preparing to take that dream to the next level,"" the obituary added. “He also found joy and confidence in modeling, expressing his individuality through art and style.”
“Samuel's life, though far too short, was filled with creativity, love, and light,” the tribute further stated. “His family and friends will remember his bright smile, adventurous spirit, and the warmth he brought to every moment.”
Samuel's mother dhared a statement in a news release about her lawsuit against Tesla. 
“How could Tesla keep selling vehicles that they know trap people inside their cars after a crash?” Jacquelyn claimed. “They could have fixed it, but they refused. Now my son is dead after suffering unmercifully. The people who did this must face consequences and the public needs to know how dangerous Tesla vehicles are in a crash.”
Tesla did not respond to PEOPLE's request for comment.","student,-20,-allegedly-died-after-being-trapped-wh","“Help please … I am going to die,” said Samuel Tremblett in a 911 call, a lawsuit his family filed on Feb. 4 claims

Shop expert-vetted loafers, sneakers, boots, and more from $19
We’ve made it to February, and the arrival of spring is starting to feel within reach. If you’re hesitant to invest in winter-friendly pieces that will be tucked away once the season ends, it may be time to start looking for styles you can wear now and later.
One of the best places to start when curating a transitional wardrobe is with your shoe collection, and we tapped fashion stylist and creative director Chelsea Volpe for her top recommendations. The standout qualities she looks for in a shoe? “A strong silhouette, thoughtful proportions, and materials that feel elevated rather than trendy-for-trendy’s-sake,” she tells PEOPLE. Below, shop picks inspired by her recommendations from $19.
“If a shoe can move seamlessly from a coat-heavy February look into a light-layers April outfit, it’s earned its place,” Volpe adds. 
Volpe says that if she “had to recommend one [shoe] above the rest,” it would be the modern loafer. “It works with tailoring, denim, and dresses,” she explains, adding that it’s best to “avoid chunky lug soles or shiny patent” when going for a transitional look. Instead, reach for a pair like this one from Amazon, as it feels substantial while still looking “visually light.” 
No winter wardrobe is complete without a pair of booties. Volpe suggests opting for a “sleek ankle boot with a slim shaft and architectural heel,” as it “works under trousers now and with bare legs later.” This style includes one of her favorite silhouette details for seasonal transitions — an almond or soft square toe — and shoppers note that they feel comfortable, even after hours of wear. 
“Refined flats, loafers, and minimalist sneakers are truly seasonless,” Volpe shares, noting that a Veja sneaker, in particular, “can live year-round” because it doesn’t “rely on weather-specific styling cues.” Pick up this pair from the brand that Reese Witherspoon, Meghan Markle, and our editors turn to for everyday comfort in a wear-with-anything black-and-white color scheme — and prepare to style it for seasons to come.
“The one standout quality all my favorite shoes share? They quietly elevate the entire look without announcing themselves. Whether it’s a sculptural heel or a perfectly proportioned loafer, the shoe never competes — it anchors,” Volpe shares.
Another sneaker Volpe recommends for winter-to-spring dressing? A low-profile option with subtle contrast detailing. “It pairs just as well with tailoring as [with] denim and doesn’t feel gym-coded,” she says. “They’re design-led, not performance-led — which is what keeps them seasonless and fashion-credible.”
If traditional loafers aren’t for you, never fear: Volpe explains that “transitional seasons are all about flexible structure,” citing backless loafers and mules as smart silhouettes to have in your wardrobe. This pair has earned hundreds of five-star ratings from shoppers for its “classy and elegant” look and “incredibly comfortable” feel.
Volpe specifically calls out Alohas flats as one of her favorite shoes for seasonal transitions, highlighting the fact that they’re “directional without being loud.” She adds, “the brand’s leather flats feel intentional, especially styled with socks now and bare ankles later. They have enough structure to ground winter outfits, but enough lightness to feel right in spring — no costume shift required.”
Extend the seasonality of your favorite flats and loafers by wearing them with socks or tights — like these — in colder temperatures.
If you struggle to stray from your comfy sneakers, a simple color shift may be all you need to feel updated for spring. “Think softened neutrals,” Volpe shares. “A pale espresso loafer or an off-white sneaker feels fresh without screaming, ‘new season.’”
The sign of a good ballet flat? One that looks “refined, intentional, and endlessly wearable,” says Volpe. This two-toned pair combines an affordable price point with a polished finish that looks “expensive,” according to one five-star reviewer.",a-stylist-told-us-the-shoes-we-need-to-seamlessly-,"If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation.

An Illinois woman is feeling like a lucky dog after checking her pet camera.
Marilyn Ewing, who goes by Mare on TikTok, shared camera footage of how her newly adopted rescue dog, Charlie, was getting along with her black Labrador, Rambo, while she and her husband, Austin Ewing, were at work.
In a clip posted on TikTok, Charlie can be seen somewhat shyly curled up on an elevated dog bed, sniffing a blanket, before Rambo hops on the bed to cuddle and comfort him.
“BRUH😭,” Mare simply captioned the heartwarming video that has since been viewed more than 170,000 times and liked over 25,000 times.
One TikTok user who watched the video imagined what Rambo “probably” was saying to Charlie while comforting him.
“It’s going to be okay. Our parents are pretty cool. Just relax with me bud,” they commented.
Mare spoke about the viral video with Newsweek, explaining that it was captured the day after she and her husband adopted Charlie.
“Our shelter dog, Charlie, was days away from being euthanized at a kill shelter in Oklahoma, so our local shelter went and picked him up and brought him back to where we live in Illinois,” she said.

Including styles to wear now and into spring
My winter wardrobe revolves around my Ugg boots collection, which has been put through the wringer this season and is in dire need of an upgrade. Fortunately, I don’t have to look too far to find a new pair (or two) for cheap.
Amazon is having a massive sale on Ugg shoes right now and popular styles are up to 60 percent off — including mini boots, slip-on clogs, and fuzzy slides, as well as versatile styles from its sister brand Koolaburra by Ugg. Prices start at just $30, so what are you waiting for? Brave the cold in style and snag yourself a pair before time runs out on these can’t-miss deals.
Amazon shoppers are selling out these fleece-lined micro boots, which “slip on and off really easily” and feel “like you're walking around in slippers.” They’re a close lookalike for the Ugg boots Sarah Jessica Parker has been wearing on repeat — and according to another reviewer, they’re “well worth the splurge for their comfort.”
Of all the Y2K fashion trends making a comeback, clogs are definitely my favorite — even Jennifer Garner is on board. This suede pair has footbeds made from flexible EVA material that contours to your feet for personalized comfort and support. The shoes have racked up over 1,900 five-star ratings, including from one shopper who said they’re “like walking on pillows made of clouds.” 
If you’re shopping for a heeled boot, opt for this combat-style from Ugg’s sister brand Koolaburra. They have a subtle lift thanks to the thick lug soles, plus rear pull tabs for added convenience and cushy foam insoles. 
Stylish yet comfortable, these lace-up sneakers are available in four neutral designs and sizes 4–14. Their uppers are made from a combination of soft suede and mesh, and a padded rim around the ankle prevents the risk of friction, blisters, and slippage.  
Get a headstart on your spring footwear lineup and snag these cushioned platform sandals while they’re as little as $30. They have a lightweight design with adjustable ankle straps and foam insoles, making them ideal for all-day wear and traveling. Pick them up in beige, brown, black, or olive green.
From the open-toe silhouette to the moisture-wicking sheepskin lining, these lightweight slides earn high praise for their coziness and versatility. Style them with a matching lounge set, an oversized crewneck and leggings (a.k.a. the perfect lazy day outfit), or a sweater and jeans. 
These structured mini boots are crafted in waterproof suede with faux-fur lining, heel tabs, thick rubber soles for maximum traction, and a warm padded collar. To sum it up: They’ll endure whatever Mother Nature throws at them whether it’s snow, rain, or sunshine. “For those with weak ankles, feet issues, and [who are] clumsy as heck, these boots are a 10/10,” wrote a five-star reviewer, who called them “my new favorite winter shoes.”","amazon-quietly-marked-down-ugg-boots,-clogs,-and-s","If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation.

Celebrity fashion trends may be fleeting, but Jennifer Garner just proved this popular color isn’t going anywhere.
The actress previously attended the Mac Barnett and Jennifer Garner Consider The Picture Book event in New York City while wearing the unexpected hue that’s taken over Kate Hudson’s, Jessica Alba’s, and our editors’ wardrobes: chocolate brown. 
While Garner’s take on the trend — a silhouette-enhancing, belted brown dress – looked like the epitome of an effortless winter outfit, we couldn’t help but notice how easily it could work for spring, too. Shop flattering options inspired by her dress at Amazon from $36.
A close match for Garner’s dress, this waist-cinching style has earned high praise from Amazon shoppers for its “elegant and versatile” design and “very comfortable” fit. One reviewer appreciated that it “skims the body in all the right places, offering a flattering fit without being too tight or too loose,” while another wrote that it “looks way more expensive than it is.” Copy the actress by pairing it with tall black boots, or dress it up with shimmery black kitten heels.
If you’re looking for a warmer dress to wear this winter, consider picking up this knit option that “looks and feels expensive,” according to one Amazon shopper. Its wool-blend fabric and long sleeves will keep you toasty in chilly temperatures, while its detachable belt offers figure definition. Channel Garner by snagging it in chocolate brown, or choose from six additional colors, including burgundy and navy blue.
Not sure what to wear to any upcoming weddings? Let this Garner-inspired dress take out the guesswork. While its belted waist, long sleeves, and V-neckline call to mind the actress’s dress, its ruched fabric and silky satin fabric feel better suited for more formal occasions. Plus, one shopper called it “perfect for a wedding,” explaining that it “feels and looks very luxurious.”

A California Uber driver has been convicted of sexually assaulting his passenger. 
On Friday, Feb. 6, the Yolo County District Attorney’s Office said in a press release that 46-year-old Safiullah Miakhil of Carmichael was convicted of two counts of sexual battery related to a Nov. 1, 2023, incident. 
Judge Catherine R. Hohenwarter presided over the case.
The victim, whose name and age were not disclosed, was a student at the University of California, Davis, at the time, authorities said.
PEOPLE reached out to Uber for comment, but did not immediately receive a response.
Just after midnight on Halloween 2023, Miakhil picked the woman up from a Halloween party in Davis and brought her to her home. As the two arrived, he exited the vehicle and got into the back seat with her. 
He then groped, kissed and fondled the victim against her will before she was able to break free and run away.
The incident was immediately reported to police.
“The young woman who was victimized in this case demonstrated immeasurable courage and tenacity, from the time of the assault in 2023, while the case took its course through the criminal court system, and especially in testifying at trial about such a traumatic event,” Yolo County Deputy District Attorney Stefanie DeCillis said.
DeCillis also thanked the jury for making the correct choice in a case of this magnitude.
“This outcome signals that sexual assault cases, especially against those in vulnerable positions, will be treated with the utmost seriousness in Yolo County,” she said.

District Attorney Jeff Reisig added, “The jury’s conviction is an affirmation to the courageous young victim in this case and a warning to the depraved who dare to think that they will get away with such perverse misconduct.” 
“We urge all riders to use caution when utilizing ride-sharing services and report any and all misconduct by drivers to authorities,” he said.
Miakhil faces a maximum sentence of one year in county jail. It is not immediately known if he has obtained an attorney.

Kaley Cuoco is opening up about difficulties she experienced during her 2022 divorce — including depression.
During a Monday, Feb. 9, appearance on the Drew Barrymore Show, the Big Bang Theory alum, 40, spoke candidly about how her mental health journey following her divorce from Karl Cook in 2022.
""I had like the crazy story when this is a handful of years ago, when I said that I was going through my divorce... it was the premiere of the second season of Flight Attendant,"" she said, referring to the April 2022 premiere of the HBO Max series.
""I woke up that morning, I was so depressed and so sad I couldn't even breathe, and I was just lying on the floor. I literally thought I was gonna die, I really did,"" she shared. ""I said, 'What am I doing?' And it was like the worst morning of my life, but knowing the night was coming, it was supposed to be the best night of my life. It's so crazy those things sometimes happen at the same time.""
Cuoco recalled her team stepping in to help her get ready for the event.
""I couldn't get up,"" she continued. ""I'm like, 'I can't go. I can't go anywhere.' I just blew up my life. My life's over. I truly thought that.""
At the time, the 8 Simple Rules alum thought she was ""never getting married again, never gonna have kids.""
""I knew when I was lying on that floor in my house, I thought, 'Oh my God, this is what they talk about. This is the lowest point I could get,' "" she shared — before revealing that she met her now-fiancé Tom Pelphrey just three weeks later.
""That's, like, supposed to be the best night ever of my career, and I literally saw my soul leave my body,"" Cuoco added. ""It still chokes me up because I can remember it so clearly, but it made me a whole new person.""
During her difficult time, Cuoco learned that it's okay to have a change heart — especially after declaring that you'll never get married again.
""You know what, guys, sometimes you just change your mind and that's okay,"" she said. "" ... You probably didn't know I was lying on the floor before my premiere, ready to die ... But it takes a long time to figure that out and a lot of forgiveness.""
The Flight Attendant star publicly confirmed her relationship with Ozark actor Pelphrey in May 2022, and in March 2023, the couple welcomed their daughter, Matilda Carmine Richie Pelphrey.
They then got engaged more than one year after Matilda's arrival in August 2024.

Prior to her marriage to Cook, Cuoco was also married to former tennis player Ryan Sweeting from December 2013 to September 2015.
Since she and Pelphrey went public with their relationship, Cuoco has been candid about her love for the actor. Speaking to PEOPLE in November, the star shared that she and her fiancé ""would love to find"" a project to work on together in the future.
""We're actually actively searching. It has to be the right one,"" she said on Nov. 7. ""It has to be special, but 100%. There's no one I'd rather work with than Tom.""
She adds, ""In fact, I'm jealous of everyone that gets to work with him because he's the best.""
Pelphrey echoed a similar sentiment, telling PEOPLE in September, ""If you would’ve told me 15 years ago that I could be with the love of my life and have the most perfect baby and get to do what I love, it’s wild. You’re living your dream. And I’m very conscious of that.""

Including editor-loved adjustable weights
I treat every Valentine’s Day as a personal challenge. How do I top last year’s present to my boyfriend? Previously, I’ve gifted him everything from a swanky golf-club fitting to a limited-edition print from his favorite artist. Since we’re traveling over this year's holiday, we’ve decided to have a more affordable approach to gifting. 
Still, a tighter budget isn’t going to stop me from impressing him. I took to the internet and found loads of luxe options, including comfy Lululemon joggers, breathable Hey Dude loafers, a smashed burger kit, and more. These $50-and-under gifts are sure to bring a smile to your man’s face — trust me, I’ve already given some of them myself. 
Among my favorite finds is this pair of soft jersey joggers from Lululemon. They’re lightweight enough for my boyfriend, who runs hot, cozy courtesy of the brushed interior, and stretchy without looking frumpy. I imagine him wearing these during snuggly evenings on the couch and long travel days. 
We’re not gifting packs of socks to our guys anymore. Hint, hint: Because we actually want them to be excited to unwrap their presents. But, I did recently buy my boyfriend this pair of sock-like slippers from Bombas, and he hasn’t taken them off since. I also recommend this best-selling pair of slip-on loafers from HeyDude, which one reviewer shared, “feel like you are not wearing shoes at all.”
These golf shorts tick all of the boxes: They’re lightweight, quick-drying, and stretchy. Plus, their inseam isn’t too short, which allows for even more comfortable movement. The material has UPF 30+, which provides extra sun protection during a balmy 18 holes.
A gifting tip? Keep an eye out for a clever gadget that will improve your sweetie’s daily life. For example, my boyfriend’s hips and legs go through the wringer during golf season, so a powerful massage gun provides relief to his aching muscles. I also recommend this wireless charger that can be set up on a desk or bedside table to accommodate an iPhone, AirPods, and Apple Watch at the same time. For music lovers, check out this portable JBL speaker that’s completely waterproof. 
Being awoken by gentle light and music sets the tone for the rest of his day. This calming alarm clock does just that, plus comes with 26 sleep sounds. A design aspect I’m impressed with? There’s a built-in battery that ensures timely wake-ups even if there’s a power outage. “It’s a more affordable alternative to the popular (but pricey) Hatch alarm clock,” shared one customer. 
Whether your boo likes to watch sports or play them, the gifts below check all athletics-related boxes. I found a sleek gym bag that he won’t feel embarrassed bringing into the office, a hat with his favorite baseball team on it — I did my research, MLB season is on the horizon — and a camping chair that’s like a foldable love seat. Not to mention, my boyfriend is obsessed with practicing on his indoor putting green during winter. 
These adjustable weights are so clever that I want to buy them for my boyfriend just so I can use them. The customizable set can be used as lone dumbbell plates, hand weights, or bar bells. I know my boyfriend would appreciate this product’s adaptability in order to execute everything from hammer curls to sumo squats. Shopping editor Clint Davis has this exact set of weights and says they're durable and that changing the weights is super easy.
In my world, cooking is a love language — some of my favorite quality-time is spent making dinner with my boyfriend. As such, I have my eye on this cast iron skillet that’s ideal for searing steaks and frying eggs, as well as this pasta maker that makes quick work of homemade dough. Plus, when the weather (eventually) warms, a smashed burger kit (that landed a spot on Oprah’s Favorite Things list) will make for fun evenings over the grill. 
Truth be told, my boyfriend bought this for himself. But! That just goes to show that it’s something men want. Perks of this purchase: It looks sleek in our kitchen, brews enough coffee for the two of us, and is easy to use. I also really appreciate that the entire contraption is dishwasher safe.
A good gift can also remind your honey to slow down and take care of themselves. Implementing new self-care practices is as easy as a foot massager that can be stowed furtively under a desk or a pack of de-puffing eye patches.
This fragrance-free face mask is the solution to dull, dry skin. Plus, it can be used as a moisturizer, 10-minute face mask, or overnight mask. Ingredients like hyaluronic acid hydrate and plump, while cucumber extract soothes. Reviewers agree it's a key part of their skincare routine throughout winter.",my-boyfriend-won’t-know-i-shopped-for-his-valentin,"If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation.

No one does fashion like Michelle Pfeiffer. 
On February 3, the 67-year-old star looked particularly polished at an Apple TV press day. She wore a silky white button-up and beige wide-leg pants, the latter of which were the focus of her functional yet fashionable ’fit. 
The bottoms’ most eye-catching quality was the deep front pleats that made her 5-foot-7-inch frame look even taller. Additionally, the pants had plenty of room throughout, meaning they would also be comfortable enough for occasions with long periods of time spent sitting (cough,cough, the office!). Plus, Julia Roberts, Jennifer Garner, and other stars also favor wide-leg pants. And now you can, too, with these picks starting at $23.  
Prettygarden left no stone untouched when crafting these pants: They have gorgeous front pleats and a “linen-like” fabric, per the brand, that washes easily at home. They’re also the most affordable out of the bunch. They have a side zipper instead of bulky front buttons, as well as a tie belt that “sets off the waist beautifully,” said a shopper who received the pants for free. TL;DR: They’re going to be ultra-forgiving. 
Anytime I see the words “slimming” and “they don't wrinkle” — as I did in this shopper’s review of these bottoms— I’m immediately convinced to add the item to my cart. On top of that, this pair, also from Prettygarden, has elastic in the waistband, so they won’t be digging into my skin all day. 
They also remind me so much of a pair I wore during my grad school era, which involved lots of commuting and desk-sitting. And still, I paired them with everything from blazers to sneakers to T-shirts and even routinely broke them out on the weekends. 
If you thought the roomy bottoms couldn’t get any more comfortable, think again: Palazzo pants are basically just wider wide-leg pants. They also look shorter than some of the other pairs, which, contrary to popular opinion, might actually be more useful in the winter. (I don’t know about you, but I hate when my pant hems get soggy and wet from the snow.) There are also 29 — yes, 29 — colors to choose from.

Bill Clinton says that despite his call to release the Jeffrey Epstein files, his attempts at transparency have not appeased the Republicans on the House Oversight Committee.
In a series of posts shared to X on Friday, Feb. 6. Clinton shared that he had agreed to ""appear in person"" before the House Oversight Committee, a move he says was ""still not enough"" for the Republicans on the Committee.
Clinton reiterated that he has already ""called for the full release"" of the Epstein files, and that he has ""provided a sworn statement of what I know"" to the Committee.
In a second post, Clinton noted that House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer ""says he wants cameras,"" referring to a Feb. 2 agreement in which the Clintons would give a closed-door deposition.
""Who benefits from this arrangement? It’s not Epstein’s victims, who deserve justice,"" Clinton wrote. ""Not the public, who deserve the truth. It serves only partisan interests. This is not fact-finding, it’s pure politics.""
The former president and his wife, Hillary Clinton, were both called to testify before the House Oversight Committee’s investigation into Epstein in August 2025. In mid-January, they both wrote a joint public letter saying that they would not testify, despite calls for both to give depositions.
House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer held a vote to hold them in criminal contempt if they don’t testify. Weeks later, the two politicians agreed to the closed-door deposition under threat of a subpoena.
Hillary is scheduled to testify on Feb. 26, and Bill is to testify on Feb. 27. However, on Thursday, Feb. 5, Hillary, 78, said that she and the former president were demanding a public hearing.
""If you want this fight, @RepJamesComer, let’s have it—in public,"" Hillary wrote in a post to her X account. ""You love to talk about transparency. There’s nothing more transparent than a public hearing, cameras on.""
The House Oversight Committee replied to Hillary on X., and posted screenshots of emails from the Clintons' attorneys agreeing to the conditions.
“Then they pretended that we were moving the goalpost when they received, along with the subpoenas, the House deposition guidance that explicitly mentions video recordings,"" the Committee's official Twitter account posted.
Bill noted in a third post on Feb. 6 that he “will not sit idly as they use me as a prop in a closed-door kangaroo court by a Republican Party running scared.”
“If they want answers, let’s stop the games & do this the right way: in a public hearing, where the American people can see for themselves what this is really about,"" he continued.

Robbie's stylist ​​Andrew Mukamal confirmed in a social media post that her shoes were designed by Christian Louboutin. Her custom Conquillas were made in Italy, and are from the fall/winter 2014–15 line, according to The Metropolitan Museum of Art. 
The front and sides of the heelless platform are pointed and smooth, while the very back boasts a spiked design running from the bottom on up and topped with a bow.
“That shoe tho,” one person commented of the Barbie star’s look on Mukamal’s post, which included a close-up of the style. Another added, “THOSE. HEELS.”
The Big Bold Beautiful Journey actress wore the eye-catching shoes with an archival Vivienne Westwood leather two-piece set from fall 1988 collection, with a low cut and sleeveless, corset bust paired with a quilted, puffy mini skirt.
For Robbie's glam, Robbie kept her makeup natural with a nude lip and short, natural nails also in a nude shade. Her blonde hair flowed past her shoulders with a part down the center. 
For her press tour looks, Robbie, who plays Catherine Earnshaw opposite Jacob Elordi’s Heathcliff in Wuthering Heights, has stayed true to the film’s theme for the adaptation of the 1847 novel by Emily Brontë.
Just one day prior to her Westwood-Louboutin combo, the Suicide Squad actress turned heads with another Wuthering Heights promo tour look made of hair.
On Thursday, Feb. 5, London-based Turkish fashion designer Dilara Findikoglu crafted the gown specifically for Robbie, inspired by the Victorian Era's obsession with hair.

Earlier in the press tour, Robbie gifted her 28-year-old co-star with bespoke matching gold rings that were made by Cece Jewellery’s Cece Fein-Hughes, who has also designed for Taylor Swift. The pieces include an inscription of a Brontë quote (""Whatever our souls are made of, his and mine are the same"") as well as Cathy and Heathcliff’s initials and ""1847-2026,"" a reference to the year the book was published and that of the new film’s release, per British Vogue.

Pants with buttons and zippers? You can keep ’em — I’m wearing comfy sweatpants instead.
I frequently eschew jeans in favor of more comfortable styles. And while I love wearing leggings because of the elastic waistband, sometimes they’re still a bit too restrictive for my liking. Enter: comfy sweatpants, which are quickly becoming my entire personality — I’m already obsessed with sweatpant jeans and velour pants, so this is the next step in my style evolution. They’ll be perfect for long travel days, Pilates workouts, running errands, and just lounging at home with a book. 
I rounded up 10 pairs of comfy sweatpants on Amazon from brands like Hanes, Nike, Varley, and Cozy Earth, starting at just $10.
These sweats are one of Amazon’s top five best-selling sweatpants with over 55,000 five-star ratings, and it’s easy to see why. They’re designed in the brand’s cozy EcoSmart fleece with a ribbed-knit waistband and subtle wide-leg silhouette, and they come in sizes S–XXL with both petite and regular inseams available.
I’ve been curious about Varley for quite some time, and these comfy sweatpants with a ruched waistband and thick elastic cuffs are definitely calling my name. “These are wonderful,” one shopper raved, calling them “so soft and such good quality.”
If you want slouchier, more lightweight sweatpants, try these joggers with a contrast drawstring around the elastic waistband and curved front pockets. They come in 19 colors, like black, charcoal gray, pink, and brown, plus sizes S–XXL.
I already own these jogger pants in charcoal gray, and I love that the 26-inch inseam fits my petite frame perfectly. They’re crafted in a buttery blend of bamboo viscose, acrylic, and spandex with a drawstring waistband and deep, angled side pockets. 
When I think of comfy sweatpants, this pair embodies that phrase to a T. The wide-leg pants are made from a blend of cotton and polyester fleece, with a ruched drawstring waistband and side pockets. They come in 17 colors and sizes S–XL.
Just because you’re wearing comfy sweatpants doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice style — and this bold red pair is ready to be noticed. The pants have an elastic waistband with an internal adjustable drawstring and elasticized cuffs that work equally well with slippers or tucked into boots.
I let out an audible gasp when I found these comfy sweatpants, which are made even more cozy thanks to fuzzy fleece lining. I also love the contrast drawcords around the waist and the fun range of 14 color options.
Whether you have a long plane ride or grueling workout ahead of you, these wide-leg sweatpants are ready to keep you comfy for hours on end. “They don’t look frumpy like traditional sweatpants — I’ve even worn them to work,” one shopper said. “[They’re] the only pair of sweatpants I’ve found that are both comfortable and fit my petite frame.”
I know I said I don’t wear denim, but I make an exception for barrel jeans since they’re so comfortable. However, I have a feeling these barrel sweatpants are about to replace the jeans altogether. They have a ruched drawstring waist, curved front pockets, and visible side seams, and they come in 18 colors.
Cargo pants have made the style rounds on celebs like Oprah Winfrey and Mindy Kaling, and you can get in on the action with these Nike sweatpants. The pull-on pants have oversized side cargo pockets and elasticized cuffs, and they come in sizes XS–XXL.",im-replacing-my-outdated-leggings-with-these-10-pa,"If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation.

As authorities in South Carolina continue to search for a missing 49-year-old woman whose car was found abandoned on the interstate, her family's concern is growing.
“My only thing is, I just want her home,” Sage Goodwin told Fox affiliate WACH about mom Sabrina Heinz on Thursday, Feb. 5. ""It's day 8 now and it's scary.""
Heinz was last seen on Jan. 28 around 10 p.m. local time working at a Shell gas station, according to the Richland County Sheriff’s Department and WACH.
Authorities were notified two days later, on Jan. 30, by the woman’s supervisor, who was concerned when Heinz didn’t show up at work, The State, CBS affiliate WLTX and NBC affiliate WYFF previously reported.
Heinz’s employer turned on the GPS monitoring of the woman's company vehicle, which was then located on the shoulder of Interstate 77 in Blythewood.
Inside, the sheriff's department found a number of personal items, including her phone, Sgt. Molly Nations told NBC and CW affiliate WIS-TV.
“It was turned on, but because there was no gas, it was not cranked, but as if it had just run out. The key was still on,” Nations told the outlet. “She means a lot to her family, and it’s very important to us that we bring her home safely.”
In her recent interview with CBS affiliate WLTX, Goodwin described Heinz as a devoted grandmother, daughter, sister and friend. 
Asked if her mother had a possible medical condition that may have led her to wander off, Goodwin stated, “Not that we know of. She’s never told us anything about it.”

Authorities intensified their search for Heinz on Thursday, including checking both sides of the interstate where her car was found, WACH reported. 
Goodwin also told the outlet that she had her own suspicions about what may have happened. 
“Now that I’ve seen pictures of the car,” Goodwin told WACH, “I don’t think my mom just pulled over on her own. I honestly feel like someone pushed her over or she was running from something.""
PEOPLE contacted the Richland County Sheriff’s Department and Samantha Heinz on Friday, Feb. 6, but did not receive immediate comment.
Heinz is described by authorities as being 5’2” and 160 lbs, and she was last seen wearing a short sleeve, collared red shirt with a black long sleeve underneath and black pants.

Tim Scott, who backed Trump's 2024 presidential campaign, urged the president to remove his post before it was ultimately taken down
Republican Sen. Tim Scott has criticized a video that President Donald Trump shared on his Truth Social account Thursday night that includes a racist depiction of former President Barack Obama and his wife, Michelle Obama, as primates.
""Praying it was fake because it's the most racist thing I've seen out of this White House,"" Scott, who is Black and represents South Carolina, said in a post on X on Friday, Feb. 6. ""The President should remove it.""
Scott endorsed Trump for president in 2024 after dropping out of the Republican primary race.
The 62-second video that Trump shared on Truth Social centered around election conspiracy theories, alleging that voting machines in battleground states had been tampered with as the 2020 presidential votes were tallied.
In the final seconds of the clip, two primates, with the Obamas' smiling faces imposed on them, appear as the song ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"" by The Tokens plays in the background. The post amplified Trump's debunked claims that the 2020 election was stolen from him.

The depiction of the nation's first Black president and first lady as primates — during Black History Month — advances a longstanding racist trope used by slave traders and segregationists to dehumanize Black people and justify their mistreatment.

White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt defended Trump's post in a statement shared with PEOPLE on Friday morning.
""This is from an internet meme video depicting President Trump as the King of the Jungle and Democrats as characters from the Lion King,"" Leavitt, 28, said. ""Please stop the fake outrage and report on something today that actually matters to the American public.""
Amid the widespread backlash that followed, the White House deleted Trump's post and shared a new statement to PEOPLE, saying: ""A White House staffer erroneously made the post. It has been taken down.""
Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer.

The video drew swift condemnation on social media, including from House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries, the first Black caucus leader in Congress, who praised the Obamas on X as ""brilliant, compassionate and patriotic Americans"" who ""represent the best of this country.""

Jeffries called Trump ""vile"" and ""unhinged"" and demanded that every Republican ""immediately denounce Donald Trump's disgusting bigotry.""
The press office for California Gov. Gavin Newsom shared a similar call, saying the Truth Social post represented ""disgusting behavior by the President"" and added: ""Every single Republican must denounce this. Now.""
Echoing Scott, Republican Rep. Mike Lawler of New York took to X on Friday and said, ""The President's post is wrong and incredibly offensive — whether intentional or a mistake — and should be deleted immediately with an apology offered.""
PEOPLE reached out to a spokesperson for the Obamas for comment.
Trump has a history of making degrading remarks about the Obamas and other people of color, including Minnesota Rep. Ilhan Omar, a vocal Trump critic, and other Somali immigrants whom he called ""garbage"" in recent months and urged to ""go back to where they came from.""
During Obama's presidency, Trump promoted false claims that the 44th president, who was born in Hawaii, was actually born in Kenya and was constitutionally ineligible to serve.
Trump also repeatedly demanded that his predecessor produce birth records and prove he was a ""natural-born citizen,"" a requirement to become president. In her memoir, Becoming, Michelle said she'd never forgive Trump for stirring up the false ""birther"" movement in 2011, thereby endangering the Obamas' two daughters, Sasha and Malia (then 10 and 13).
""The whole thing was crazy and mean-spirited, of course, its underlying bigotry and xenophobia hardly concealed,"" she wrote. ""But it was also dangerous, deliberately meant to stir up the wingnuts and kooks.""",gop-senator-calls-video-of-obamas-as-apes-the-most,"South Carolina Sen.

Halle Berry is ready to walk down the aisle with Van Hunt!
Berry, 59, announced the next milestone in their relationship during an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Thursday, Feb. 5. The actress told host Jimmy Fallon that fans have some ""confusion"" about her and Hunt's relationship status after their almost six years of dating.
""There's some confusion that he asked to marry me and I said no,"" Berry said.
""But, that's not the case?"" Fallon asked after Berry was interrupted by a ""jealous"" heckler in the audience.
""No, that's not the case,"" she said. ""I did not say 'no,' we just don't have a date. Of course, I said 'yes, I would marry him.' ""
""I'm so happy, you guys are a great couple,"" Fallon said. ""Security, please have that guy taken out, bye,"" he joked, referring to the heckler. ""No. I'm so happy, you guys are a great couple. Congratulations.""
Showing her engagement ring, Berry said of Hunt, ""Thank you. He did put a little ring on it.""
Fallon was visibly surprised by the size of the rock on Berry's ring finger saying, ""Oh, a little.""

Berry's decision to publicly confirm her engagement to Hunt comes after he revealed back in June 2025 that he had already proposed to her, but she said no. 
""I put out the proposal, and it’s still on hold as you can see,"" the singer-songwriter told Today.com after having his first joint interview with Berry on the June 4 episode of Today with Jenna & Friends. ""It’s just out there floating. You know, maybe you can encourage her.""
At the time, Berry rejected his proposal because of their past failed marriages.
The Catwoman star previously tied the knot three times. She was married to her first ex-husband, former MLB player David Justice, from 1993 to 1997; second ex-husband, singer-actor Eric Benét, from 2001 to 2005, and third ex-husband Olivier Martinez from 2013 to 2016.
Meanwhile, Hunt has been divorced once.
""We don’t feel like we have to get married to validate our love in any way. We don't,” Berry told the outlet, later noting, ""I think we will get married just because, out of the people I’ve been married to, this is the person I should have married. And I feel like I should, we should get married, but it’s not because we feel like we have to. I think it’s something that we would like to do just because we want that expression.""
The duo first met in 2020 and bonded virtually during the COVID-19 pandemic. Berry made her relationship with Hunt Instagram official in September 2020 after months of teasing a new romance. She confirmed she was dating the ""Seconds Of Pleasure"" singer by sharing a cheeky photo of herself wearing Hunt's tour merchandise.
""Now ya know... ♥️🦶🏽,"" Berry wrote in the caption. Her foot emoji referenced two Instagram posts she shared in July 2020 and August 2020 of her feet playing footsie with her new beau.
At the time, a source told PEOPLE the couple had been seeing each other for ""several months"" and that he had met Berry's two children. Berry shares 12-year-old son Maceo with ex Martinez. She's also a mother to 17-year-old daughter Nahla, whom she shares with ex Gabriel Aubry.
Hunt and Berry made their red carpet debut together at the 2021 Academy Awards. Later that year in October, Berry gushed about Hunt at the Elle Women in Hollywood Awards, giving him a special shout out. ""My love, love, love — my sweetheart,"" she said. ""I've never had a man that has lifted me up and let me be all that I am.""
The following month in November 2021, the pair had an impromptu ""commitment ceremony,"" performed by a then-8-year-old Maceo.
""This was a ceremony by an 8-year-old in the back seat of the car who said, 'Mom, you should get married to him.' I said, 'Really, I should marry him?' "" Berry explained on Live with Kelly and Ryan. ""He said, 'Yeah, I pronounce you man and wife.' So we're like, 'Oh, okay. We're married!' But we're not married. So, that's our commitment ceremony.""
Over the years, the couple has been open about their love for one another at events and on social media. 
In November 2021, Hunt detailed his favorite qualities about Berry in an essay published on Berry's website ""re-spin.""
""Halle waits on nothing and leads the rhythm where she wants it to go. She knows that magic is made, and she was not made for waiting on it to happen,"" he wrote. ""...There's a fairytale quality to her generosity that unfolds like a shimmering Christmas morning.""
During the 4th Annual Celebration of Black Cinema & Television, Berry called Hunt ""the love of my life."" She said, ""Because I failed so many times, I now know what [love] really looks like. And so my partner is here tonight, Van, and you have supported me.""
Berry echoed these sentiments in September 2024, telling Marie Claire that Hunt is her ""person."" Of navigating their relationship, Berry said that it “took me a minute to get it right,” but “the nature of the way this happened, I have a real belief that this is it. This is my person.”",halle-berry-gets-engaged-to-van-hunt-after-5-years,"The actress confimed her engagement to partner Van Hunt during an appearance on ‘The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon’

Jaclyn Shaw was born and raised in California, where one is unlikely to encounter someone who lives in the Amish tradition — or at least less likely than in a place like Northern Indiana, where she lived when she was starting a family.
Shaw's husband grew up in the Midwestern town where they relocated during the COVID-19 pandemic, so he was somewhat accustomed to the neighboring Amish population. He even went to school with some Amish kids, who often receive a ""traditional"" education until around eighth grade. Shaw, on the other hand, couldn't help but voice her shock every time they passed a horse and buggy along the road.
""I was always fascinated, like, 'Oh my gosh, there's an Amish person. How crazy,'"" Shaw tells PEOPLE years after her initial move. ""I was like, 'What in the world? I need to know more.'""
She was still curious when they welcomed their first child together, a daughter, and started raising her in that rural Indiana area. Since it was such a small, tight-knit community, there were only so many options for childcare. Shaw was hoping to get her daughter, who was born in June 2022, into a daycare program, but in the meantime, some of her husband's childhood friends suggested they might look into hiring an Amish nanny.
""They had Amish nannies for their children because they lived further out in the country,"" she explains. ""There were actual Amish people that were their neighbors, and that's how they introduced that idea to me like, 'Oh, we had that and they were great. They took great care of the kids. They learned all the ways of farming and things like that.'""
While Shaw didn't necessarily need her daughter to learn how to work on a farm, she was certainly open to the idea of such a unique helping hand. That's when she met Rosanna, the 22-year-old Amish woman whom Shaw hired as a nanny, as she's since mentioned to her 33,000 TikTok followers in several videos.
Admittedly, the new mom was a little nervous when she and Rosanna initially met, worrying in part about sparking too much culture shock, but also about how Rosanna could best do her job. When Rosanna first asked to take her daughter for a walk, Shaw remembers feeling some hesitation. The nanny didn't have a phone, per Amish tradition, and wouldn't be able to call if something happened during the stroll.
Eventually, they got to a point of trusting each other, and since their town was so small, the California native ultimately allowed Rosanna to take the baby out without a means of constant communication.
Shaw also realized that despite the conservative, traditionalist nature of Rosanna's life, the young woman knew far more about modern life than one might expect. In the early days of Rosanna coming around, Shaw tiptoed around her, trying to avoid any awkward encounters.
""At first I treated her as if she was an alien a little bit,"" she says. ""I just didn't want to say things that she didn't feel comfortable with or that she didn't know what I was talking about.""
Since she worked from home, Shaw was able to guide Rosanna through the house, showing her things like their Google Home device and explaining that they often used it to play music for their daughter. Little did Shaw know, Rosanna had a relatively comprehensive understanding of things like technology, having just finished her Rumspringa, the rite of passage that allows many young Amish individuals to experience life and freedom outside of their communities.

""The funniest thing that happened was literally the first day she was there, I had a keyboard in my house, just an electric keyboard,"" says Shaw. ""When my daughter was sleeping, Rosanna just whipped out the keyboard and just started playing hymns and singing on the electric keyboard. I was like, 'What is going on?'""
After learning how much Rumspringa exposed Rosanna to the modern world, Shaw was curious to know more about the experience. ""She told me a bit about hers, and I was like, 'Girl, I can't relate to you. I think you've done more things than I have,'"" Shaw recalls with a laugh.",new-mom-hires-amish-woman-as-nanny.-shes-shocked-b,"Jaclyn Shaw and her husband moved to a rural town in Northern Indiana, where they welcomed their first child together in 2022

DJ Young Slade, was reported missing from the family home on Tuesday, Feb. 3
Lil Jon's son is dead after a body was discovered in the area he had been reported missing from in Georgia.
On Friday, Feb. 6, the Milton Police Department released a statement on social media announcing that a body, which they believe to be the rapper's 27-year-old son Nathan Smith, was recovered from a pond.
In the statement, the police department wrote that after Smith went missing on Tuesday, Feb. 3, officers determined that he ""had left his residence under unusual circumstances"" and search efforts began.
""After being unable to locate Mr. Smith during that time, teams expanded the search to include a pond in Mayfield Park near Smith’s Milton residence,"" the statement read. ""On February 6, 2026, at approximately 11:53 a.m., divers with the Cherokee County Fire Department located and recovered a body from the pond. The individual is believed to be Nathan Smith, pending official confirmation by the Fulton County Medical Examiner’s Office.""
According to the statement, there is ""no indication of foul play"" but it continues to be ""an open and active investigation.""
""No further details will be released until the official cause and manner of death are determined by the Fulton County Medical Examiner and all investigative leads have been thoroughly examined,"" the statement concluded. ""We extend our deepest condolences to the Smith family during this difficult time. The department respectfully asks the community and members of the media to honor the family’s request for privacy as they grieve and navigate this tragedy.""
Shortly following the announcement, Lil Jon released a statement on the tragedy to PEOPLE.
""I am extremely heartbroken for the tragic loss of our son, Nathan Smith. His mother and I are devastated,"" he said. ""Nathan was the kindest human being you would ever meet. He was immensely caring, thoughtful, polite, passionate, and warmhearted — he loved his family and the friends in his life to the fullest. He was an amazingly talented young man; a music producer, an artist and engineer, and graduate of NYU.""
The statement continued, ""We loved Nathan with all of our hearts and are incredibly proud of him. He was loved and appreciated, and in our last times together we’re comforted in knowing that we expressed that very sentiment to him.""

""Thank you for all of the prayers and support in trying to locate him over the last several days,"" the statement concluded. ""Thank you to the entire Milton Police Department involved: Detective Dula Milton, Investigators Sergeant Scott Lappin, Detective Randy Dula, Detective Sarah Moore, and Detective Daniel Williams.

The Milton Police Department issued the missing person report for the rapper's son on social media on Feb. 3, noting that Smith was last seen at 6 a.m. the same day ""in the vicinity of Baldwin Dr./Mayfield Rd. in Milton.""
""Subject ran out of his house and has been missing since. Subject left on foot and does not possess a phone. He may be disoriented and in need of assistance. Family and friends are concerned for his safety,"" the statement read.
In a statement shared with PEOPLE Tuesday, Lil Jon's rep said, ""The family is asking for privacy at this time. We are also asking for continued prayers for Nathan to come home safe. Thank you.""
The ""Turn Down for What"" rapper, born Jonathan Smith, shares Nathan with estranged wife Nicole Smith. Lil Jon, 53, and Smith tied the knot in 2004 and announced their ""amicable split"" in February 2024. In the announcement, they noted they broke up nearly two years prior.
Nathan was a DJ and musician who performs under the name DJ Young Slade or Slade. He released his latest single, ""Feels,"" in March 2025.
Last year, Nathan appeared on MTV's Family Legacy and opened up about growing up with Lil Jon as a father in an interview with The Quintessential Gentleman.
""It’s dope to appreciate my dad, show respect, and just look at all the things he’s done, and it’s nice to get the torch passed down and do my own thing,"" Nathan said at the time.

Timothy Busfield has been indicted by a grand jury.
On Friday, Feb. 6, Bernalillo County District Attorney Sam Bregman announced that a Bernalillo County grand jury indicted Busfield, 68, on four charges.
The actor was indicted on four counts of criminal sexual contact of a child, according to Bregman. All four charges are third-degree felonies, according to court documents obtained by PEOPLE.
""As with all criminal proceedings, Mr. Busfield is presumed innocent unless and until proven guilty in a court of law,"" Bregman stated in the announcement which was shared on his social media account. ""This case will proceed through the judicial process and is expected to move forward to trial.""
The Special Victims Unit of the Bernalillo County District Attorney’s Office will be prosecutors on the case, per the statement, and Bregman ""emphasized that protecting children remains a top priority for his office.""
""The Bernalillo County District Attorney’s Office remains committed to doing everything possible to protect children and ensure justice for victims across New Mexico,"" the announcement concluded.
In a statement from Busfield's civil attorney Stanton ""Larry"" Stein, he said the ""indictment was not unexpected.""
""As the saying goes, a grand jury will indict a ham sandwich,"" the statement continued. ""What is deeply concerning is that the District Attorney is choosing to proceed on a case that is fundamentally unsound and cannot be proven at trial. The detention hearing exposed fatal weaknesses in the State’s evidence — gaps that no amount of charging decisions can cure. This prosecution appears driven by something other than the facts or the law. Mr. Busfield will fight these charges at every stage and looks forward to testing the State’s case in open court — where evidence matters — not behind closed doors.""
Busfield turned himself in and was booked by authorities on Jan. 13, just four days after the Albuquerque Police Department (APD) issued a warrant for his arrest, alleging that he engaged in unlawful sexual conduct with 11-year-old twin boys. 
The district attorney then filed a motion for pretrial detention against Busfield, which sought to keep him detained until trial. Because of New Mexico’s no-bond detention rule, defendants are otherwise released on recognizance (ROR), with or without conditions.
On Jan. 20, the Field of Dreams actor was released with conditions while he awaits trial, following a two-hour pretrial detention hearing in a San Bernalillo, New Mexico district court. His wife, Melissa Gilbert, was in attendance and was seen crying and whispering, ""Thank you, God,"" when the release was announced.
After being released on his own recognizance, Busfield has been ordered to appear for all his future court dates and is not allowed to possess any firearms or dangerous weapons, consume any alcohol or illegal drugs, have contact with the alleged victims or their families, discuss the case with any witnesses or have unsupervised contact with any minor children. The judge also allowed him to travel, but he will be under the supervision of Pretrial Services in New Mexico.
Busfield spoke out for the first time before surrendering on Jan. 13 in a video obtained by TMZ. ""I did not do anything,"" he said on camera. ""They're all lies and I did not do anything to those little boys and I'm gonna fight it. I'm gonna fight it with a great team, and I'm gonna be exonerated, I know I am, because this is all so wrong and all lies.""
Moments later, a rep for Gilbert issued a statement on the actress' behalf. ""During this period, her focus is on supporting and caring for their very large family, as they navigate this moment,"" the statement read, in part. ""Melissa stands with and supports her husband and will address the public at an appropriate time. We ask that their privacy be respected.”

Officer Marvin Brown, who issued the warrant for Busfield's arrest on Jan. 9, alleged that 11-year-old siblings were the subject of sexual misconduct by Busfield, and one alleged that the incidents began when he was 7 years old.
The warrant, which was obtained by PEOPLE, stated that the victims' parents told Brown that the minors met Busfield on the set of the FOX series The Cleaning Lady, where he served as a director and they were child actors. The television show ran from January 2022 until June 2025.
An investigation into Busfield began in November 2024 when a doctor at the University of New Mexico Hospital (UNMH) alerted police about alleged sexual abuse after the parents took their children to UNMH under advisement from an attorney, per the warrant. Professionals allegedly suggested the boys ""were groomed,"" the warrant said.
Brown said the siblings had not disclosed any sexual contact at this time, but both claimed Busfield “would tickle them on the stomach and legs.” It was later determined that the case did not meet authorities' acceptance criteria.
In October 2025 per the warrant, the victims' mother filed a police report and told Child Protective Services (CPS) that “her children both disclosed that there was sexual abuse by Timothy from around November 2022 to Spring 2024."" 
The mother told authorities on Sept. 2, 2025 and Sept. 22, 2025 that her son told his counselor that Busfield inappropriately touched him.
Busfield allegedly told police that the parents were upset their sons had been replaced with a younger actor who auditioned, according to the warrant. Soon after, he got a call from Warner Bros., informing him they were investigating a complaint against him.
A representative at Warner Bros. Television told PEOPLE in a statement, ""The health and safety of our cast and crew is always our top priority, especially the safety of minors on our productions. We take all allegations of misconduct very seriously and have systems in place to promptly and thoroughly investigate, and when needed, take appropriate action. [We] have been and will continue to cooperate with law enforcement.""

Busfield has also faced prior sexual assault allegations dating back to 1994, according to his warrant. 
In a pretrial detention motion filed on Jan. 14, Busfield faced another accusation of sexual abuse. ""Another victim's father,"" Colin Swift, reported to law enforcement on Jan. 13 that Busfield allegedly had sexually abused Swift's daughter ""several years ago"" in Sacramento, Calif., per the motion.

Family members of the victims of the Lane Bryant murders are continuing to look for answers.
On Feb. 2, 2008, an unknown suspect entered a Lane Bryant location in Tinley Park, Ill., where four employees were on shift, tending to two customers. The assailant, posing as a delivery driver, entered the store and tied up the six women inside.
Rhoda McFarland, 42; Connie Woolfolk, 37; Jennifer Bishop, 34; Carrie Chiuso, 33; Sarah Szafranski, 22, were all shot execution style and died of their injuries. The sixth woman shot, a part-time employee at the store who survived her injuries, has never been publicly identified by police. One of the women was also sexually assaulted by the suspect, though police have never revealed which of the victims was involved.
The surviving victim was able to relay details to police about the suspect's appearance, while his voice can be heard on a 911 call reporting the incident.

The horrific crime, which changed countless lives that day, is the subject of an upcoming documentary by former America's Most Wanted producer Charlie Minn.
“The Tinley Park 5” is slated to debut Feb. 13 in a number of local theaters in the area. Minn told WBEZ Chicago that he's hoping ""to start some chatter here.""
""The whole point is to stir up enough attention, raise enough awareness, to solve the case... This case has faded, people are busy, they move on. I hope people see this and become as angry as I am about what happened.""
Also hopeful is Mike Hudek, brother of Carrie Chiuso, who continues to want answers for his family.
""I kind of had to forgive and let that go right after it happened, because I was going down that rabbit hole of why and what if and what could have been done, you can't undo what happened,"" Hudek told CBS News Chicago.
""This individual is not going to be caught until somebody speaks up or identifies who he is. I mean, he's somebody's son, grandson, nephew... whatever the case may be, somebody's aware of who this individual is.""
Hudek likes to remember his sister for the life she lived rather than the tragic manner in which it came to an end.
""We remember her in other ways. I mean, this is, of course, a tragic event, and we will certainly have a toast tonight in her honor around the dinner table,"" he said.
While the case remains unsolved, Tinley Park police ensure the investigation is still ongoing.
""This investigation has never stopped,” Police Chief Tom Tilton told ABC7 Chicago. “Our detectives and partners continue to evaluate leads, review evidence and apply available investigative and forensic tools as they evolve. This work occurs every day.”",5-lane-bryant-employees-inexplicably-killed-in-ill,"The crime continues to leave a mark on the Tinley Park community, though the store itself was repurposed in 2013 after sitting vacant for 6 years

Diamonds are the Colberts' best friends!
Stephen Colbert, 61, demonstrated his impeccable taste in jewels on the Thursday, Feb. 5 episode of The Late Show when he invited his wife, Evie McGee Colbert, to join him on air as part of his comedic ""First Drafts"" segment. Stephen — who has been married to the actress for more than three decades — had a surprise in store for Evie: a tell-tale Tiffany Blue box.
""Of course it wouldn't be Valentine's Day,"" Stephen began, already shouting over building applause, ""without my wife, Evie!""
Cheers erupted as Evie, clad in a ruched pink floral dress, walked on stage, and the actress greeted her husband with a kiss before waving to the crowd.
Even though there were still nine days until Valentine's Day, Stephen apparently couldn't wait another second to present Evie with a large, square Tiffany box — and Evie's eyes widened at the sight of it. The pair playfully squabbled about who got to open the gift, and ultimately Stephen untied the bow and undid the package to reveal a stunning Tiffany & Co. necklace.
The Late Show with Stephen Colbert
""This is real. This is from Tiffany,"" Stephen said, as he unveiled the sparkling necklace, a bold statement piece featuring unique chain links featuring tons of pave diamonds.
""Holy s***!"" Evie gasped as she grew giddy with joy. ""Can I touch it?"" she asked, though Stephen did her one better as he stood to drape the necklace around her. ""Happy Valentine's Day,"" he added as Evie beamed.
""Who'd you have to rob to pay for this?"" Evie joked. She then mused aloud if he (or she) did something wrong, speculating that the necklace may have been some sort of apology gift.
Once Stephen clarified that no, he didn't do anything wrong and no, it wasn't an extra sparkly apology, he revealed the catch: the necklace is a loan from Tiffany, which sent a set of ""armed guards"" to protect the necklace for the seven minutes it hung around Evie's neck (or ""however long the joke lasts,"" Stephen added).
Evie let out a huge laugh as Stephen said, ""That's, like, a quarter of a million-dollar necklace,"" His wife immediately joked, ""Take it off!""
Stephen then made light of his show's soon-approaching end, which parent company CBS decided to conclude in May 2026 as a ""purely financial decision,"" per its announcement in July 2025.
""I was going to charge [the necklace] to CBS, but they seem a little tight on cash right now,"" Stephen joked, drawing raucous laughter from the audience.

Later in the segment, Stephen and Evie — who tied the knot in October 1993 and have since welcomed three children together — read off the list of qualities that the actress's 12-year-old self once considered to make the ""perfect guy.""
Her ideal man would have a ""good personality"" and be a person with humor, generosity, kindness. He should also be ""daring"" and ""fun-loving"" — and last but not least, Evie once wrote, he should be an ""all-out man.""
To that, Stephen dramatically whipped off his glasses, stared into the camera and said, ""I'm an all-in man.""",stephen-colbert-surprises-wife-evie-mcgee-colbert-,"'Who'd you have to rob to pay for this?' Evie joked

As the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots practice ahead of the 2026 Super Bowl, the players' wives, girlfriends and fiancés are laying out their own game plans for championship-worthy outfits.
Ahead of the big game on Sunday, Feb. 8, at Levi's Stadium, the WAGs shared with PEOPLE all that goes into their unique sideline style. While some prefer to let their team spirit sing by backdropping merch on a simple, solid pair of jeans, others opt wear their heart on their sleeves — literally — with custom garments emblazoned with their significant other's number or name.
Find out how five women of the NFL calculate the perfect game day outfit — and how they'll be bringing fashion to the Super Bowl this year.
Seattle skies tend to skew gloomy, but Mackenzie Mae Cole tells PEOPLE the weather doesn't truly inhibit her plans when dressing up to watch her fiancé, Seahawks wide receiver Jake Bobo, take the field.
Cole has an easy ""go-to"" outfit formula, usually donning a ""good pair of jeans,"" some boots and a piece of Seahawks merch to get into the spirit, whether that's a team hat, jacket or top.
""I've done some different stuff during playoffs, but I feel like I keep it pretty simple,"" she says. ""Some of the girls on our team can throw together the coolest jackets and stuff like that. I'm just not really crafty, so I play it pretty simple, but the game days are really long, so comfort is huge.""

Devon Witherspoon's girlfriend Nijeria McClain is all about wearing custom-made clothes when she's watching football. Her bespoke Seattle Seahawks merch ranges in style, but she always finds a way to shout out her high school sweetheart.
""You can go simple and you can go bold, but as long as there's a cute little number or name. To me, that's what I look for: the details,"" she tells PEOPLE. ""I think the customization definitely makes the fit.""
Ahna Kreitinger, the soon-to-be wife of Seahawks safety Ty Okada, also swears by the statement piece rule when it comes to outfit planning. ""And if you're big balling, and hell, and you have three standout objects, great,"" she adds.
Once she knew her fiancé would be making his Super Bowl debut this year, Kreitinger says she didn't waste any time placing an order for her look's standout centerpiece. But after a back-and-forth with customer support, she learned it wouldn't arrive on time for her to wear to Levi's Stadium.
""I found a plan B, and she's supposed to arrive today, and I leave today,"" she tells PEOPLE just days before the NFL championship. ""So I'm sitting here — how am I supposed to be productive when I have clothes in the air right now trying to make it to me?""
Still, Kreitinger is excited to bring out a new side of her wardrobe on the big day.
""The star of my show for the Super Bowl is a necktie, which is out of my comfort zone,"" she explains. ""I haven't leaned into the masculine side of things in my game day outfits, but I'm down for a risk.""

Seahawks star Chris Stoll's wife, Maddie Stoll, is a self-proclaimed fashion lover, so it comes as no surprise that she says outfits are the first thing on her mind come game day.
""I always try to pick one item that is the statement and then build from there,"" she says. ""For the NFC Championship, my brother and sister ... got me this custom jacket [for Christmas], so I took that and built around it.""
Crucially, she notes that the best sideline style comes from a place of authenticity. ""Dress because you love it. Dress because this is what you wanted to do,"" she says. ""Fashion is so individualistic and it can express so many things, but the main thing is that you like what you're wearing.""
Emily Carlson has cheered on her fiancé Nick Kallerup since his collegiate football years, when they were both students at the University of Minnesota. Back then, the game day style stakes were slightly lower, since pretty much anything she wore would be shrouded by a big winter coat.
Kallerup's rookie season with the Seattle Seahawks hasn't just led to his first Super Bowl — it's also allowed Carlson to embrace football-friendly fashion. She tells PEOPLE she pulled plenty of inspiration from WAGs she followed on social media and leaned into some more bespoke options to spruce up her looks.
""There's a huge pool of very talented people, either through Etsy or through Instagram, that make these amazing pieces,"" she explains. ""My thing going into it was like, 'Okay, I want to find a person and then just order a bunch of stuff and then figure out how I'm using it throughout the season.' So that's kind of what I did.""
She adds, ""What I've tried to do — and I haven't done an amazing job — but I don't want to buy a lot of things that I'm only wearing one time and then never wearing it again. So I'm hoping we're with the Seahawks for a long time.""",5-super-bowl-wags-reveal-their-secrets-to-the-perf,"The Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots will face off in the championship game on Sunday, Feb. 8 at Levi's Stadium

While all eyes are on the two teams set to appear in the 2026 Super Bowl on Sunday, Feb. 8, there are countless other individuals who have been preparing for weeks to support the Seattle Seahawks and the New England Patriots in Santa Clara, Calif.

Aside from the family members and support staff accompanying the teams to the Super Bowl, the Seattle Seahawks Dancers will also be on the sidelines.

According to Jacqueline Schneider, who is an assistant sideline coach for the Seahawks Dancers and was a dancer herself for the Seahawks at two previous Super Bowls, prepping to get the dancers Super Bowl sideline ready can be quite similar to preparing for a regular game.

""You would expect it to have changed over the last 12 years,"" Schneider, who performed at both Super Bowls in 2024 and 2015. ""But as far as the dancers and cheerleaders' commitment on game day, it's very similar to years past.""
However, the Super Bowl is not just a regular game, which means that there are a few things that dancers and squad management need to keep an eye out for.

Read along below to find out about some of the little-known things that go into getting a cheer squad performance ready for football's biggest game.

Since the final two teams for the Super Bowl depend on the outcome of each game leading up to it, dancers at the Super Bowl don't know they're going until the final championship game, barely two weeks before it takes place.
""It prolonged their season now that we're in postseason,"" Schneider explains. ""So [the dancers] have been practicing every single week since May.""

""They had I think a couple weeks off here and there, but I mean they've been working so hard this season and then they've been at practice all month. They've had rehearsals for the Super Bowl because the off-season is week by week. So we're just like, 'OK we do, I guess we have practice again next week,'"" Schneider says.

The dancers also have extra practices for their additional media appearances throughout the Super Bowl festivities.

According to Schneider, one thing that is different about the way the Super Bowl is structured for dancers and cheer squads is where the performers are stationed throughout the stadium.

""Typically at home, we're spread out between all four corners of the field,"" Schneider explains, sharing how the dancers often do multiple performances in each end zone, and are stationed around all four corners of the field during play.

At the Super Bowl, however, the opposing team's spirit squads are split up on each sideline, and each team gets to perform a routine in the end zone during one of the quarter changes.
While dancers might be used to taking to the field during the halftime show on their home turf, the Super Bowl is quite literally a whole different ball game.

Instead of performances by representatives from each NFL team, as many have during regular-season games, the Super Bowl halftime show can almost be classified as its own event.

This year, Bad Bunny will take to the stage to headline the 2026 Super Bowl Halftime Show.
“What I'm feeling goes beyond myself,"" Bad Bunny said in a previous press release about his performance. ""It's for those who came before me and ran countless yards so I could come in and score a touchdown… this is for my people, my culture, and our history. Ve y dile a tu abuela, que seremos el HALFTIME SHOW DEL SUPER BOWL.”

Of regular halftime shows, Schneider says, ""If we have a really big halftime show, then we'll get there a little bit earlier to extend our pregame rehearsal.""

""So the dancers arrive, they start stretching, they start rehearsing in the locker room, and then we take them out on the field for pregame practice,"" she continues. ""And so they're running all of their routines, all of their sidelines, fillers or what we call them and their feature routines and then any sort of halftime performance if there is one.""

In the weeks leading up to the Super Bowl, the dancers have had extra practices not only for their Super Bowl performances, but for all of the appearances preceding the big day.

""They have a countless media appearances this week, starting the past Monday. And then dance performances, community events and of course practice. We'll have practice again in San Francisco for the Super Bowl on Sunday,"" Schneider reveals.

""Prep in the last couple of weeks has been Courtney, our director, handling a lot of the PR and media requests because of, and that goes from just local up into everything going on in San Francisco,"" Schneider tells PEOPLE of her side of things.

""When you've made it this far in the game, there's a huge uptick in requests. And so managing all of that as well as our dancers, putting in the extra time to do that on top of their full-time jobs and their professional lives and personal lives — t's been a whirlwind, I think, for everyone, but in the best way,"" she adds.",seahawks-dancers-coach-gives-an-inside-look-into-t,"Jacqueline Schneider is an assistant sideline coach for the Seattle Seahawks Dancers and she tells PEOPLE about what goes into getting a cheer squad Super Bowl ready

The Idiotka director is singing her cast's praises.
Writer-director Nastasya Popov told PEOPLE at the film's Thursday, Feb. 5 premiere in New York City that rapper Saweetie, 32, fit right in on the set of the comedy. The film follows a strapped-for-cash fashion designer (Anna Baryshnikov) who enters a fashion reality show competition to try and prevent her family from losing their L.A. apartment.

""I think that watching how funny [Benito Skinner is], like, I never got to watch Benito Skinner work until he was on set with me. Just seeing his improv and his comedy is just truly one-of-a-kind and once-in-a-generation,"" Popov says, when asked who on the cast surprised her with their performances during filming.
""He was making us all cry with laughter. Saweetie was also great. She hasn't acted a ton, but she was a natural,"" adds Popov.

""And, of course, Julia Fox is just, like, Julia Fox!"" Popov adds, with a laugh. ""They're so down to earth. I'm lucky that they were all so humble and easy to work with and made my job really easy. So it was surreal but also incredible.""
Skinner, 32, Saweetie and Fox, 36, play judges in the movie's fictional fashion reality competition, depicted as similar to Project Runway or America's Next Top Model. 
""It was kind of the perfect role for me at the time,"" Fox tells PEOPLE on the red carpet. ""I really got to have an alter ego and just play this really out. I guess I am kind of outrageous, but even more to alter [myself].""

Saweetie made her acting debut in 2021 when she appeared in three episodes of the series Grown-ish. She also made an appearance on a 2023 episode of the series Bel-Air as herself and similarly lent her voice for a cameo as herself in a 2024 episode of the HBO Max series Velma.

A synopsis for Idiotka teases that Baryshnikov, 33, portrays ""disgraced fashion designer with a dangerously low credit score, Margarita, [who] enters a reality show with a six-figure cash prize to save her babushka’s West Hollywood apartment.""
""But as the competition intensifies, slick producer Nicol (Camila Mendes) pushes her to spin her family’s struggle into spectacle, forcing Margarita to decide whether to play along or take control of her own narrative, one unhinged look at a time,"" the synopsis adds.

Margot Robbie is still in disbelief that she scooped a leading role in the upcoming Wuthering Heights movie.
The actress, 35, spoke candidly about her role in the film adaptation of Emily Brontë’s 1847 gothic novel of the same name during an appearance on The Graham Norton Show on Friday, Feb. 6. She appeared on the chat show hosted by Norton, alongside her costar Jacob Elordi.
It is not yet known if director Emerald Fennell’s 2026 adaptation will stay true to the original story.
“I wasn’t always going to be in it. I was thrilled to be the producer, but at some point, we were talking about Cathy, and I decided to throw my hat into the ring,” said Robbie, referring to the female lead character, Catherine Earnshaw.
Robbie continued, “I’ve always wanted to be one of Emerald’s actors and fortunately, she felt the same way. It worked out wonderfully.”
Filmmaker Fennell is best known for projects such as Saltburn and Promising Young Woman. 
In Wuthering Heights, she cast Elordi, 28, as Heathcliff, an orphan who forms an intense bond with the daughter of the wealthy family he’s taken in by, Catherine. The novel focuses on their doomed romance, class divide and the impact on their families.
“Emerald loves the book and she really focused on the feeling it gave her when she first read it at 14,” said Robbie. “She channels that raw emotional experience so it’s an interpretation rather than an adaptation. 
“In my opinion, it is one of the greatest love stories of all time and it has a great cast and incredible actors. It’s a great film,” she added.

While Robbie and Elordi star as Catherine and Heathcliff, the rest of the Wuthering Heights cast includes Hong Chau, Alison Oliver, Shazad Latif, Martin Clunes and Ewan Mitchell.
Charlotte Mellington and Adolescence's Owen Cooper play young Catherine and Heathcliff.
Elordi, who recently received an Oscar nomination for Frankenstein, confessed his role in the movie came as a surprise. 
Speaking on The Graham Norton Show, Elordi said, “I was traveling when I got a text message from [Fennell] saying, ‘Do you want to be Heathcliff?’ and I wrote, ‘Yeah.’ ” 
Wuthering Heights is set to be released ahead of Valentine’s Day on Friday, Feb. 13.

Nick Jonas’ latest body of work is his most vulnerable yet.
The “Gut Punch” singer, 33, released his new solo album, Sunday Best, on Friday, Feb. 6. The project features insights into Jonas’ personal life both in its songs and cover image, a photo of him looking in the bathroom mirror with his Dexcom G7 continuous glucose monitor visible on his arm and artwork featuring handprints that appear to be from him, his wife Priyanka Chopra and their daughter Malti Marie, 4.
Over the project’s 11 songs, Jonas bares his soul through lyrics about his past and present experiences as a musician, husband and father: learning about his type 1 diabetes diagnosis, dealing with self-criticism, playing games with Malti and more. The album’s personal nature is further illustrated by its lack of collaborations — aside from one, “The Greatest,” with the Jonas Brothers.
Sonically, Sunday Best finds Jonas exploring his soulful side with live instrumentation and choir-like background vocals — which he’s brought to life at several pop-up preview shows, including a full live premiere of the album at New York City’s Irving Plaza on Thursday, Feb. 5.
Jonas recently sat down with PEOPLE to discuss creating Sunday Best amid the Jonas Brothers’ busy tour schedule, offering fans insight into his life, featuring his continuous glucose monitor on the album’s cover, his journey with diabetes and how he’s teaching Malti about the disease.
PEOPLE: Over the past two years you have done two tours, an album and a movie with the Jonas Brothers, plus The Last Five Years on Broadway. And I believe you worked on another couple of films in that time in addition to being a father. How did you find time to not only make this album, but gather the inspiration for new solo music?
Nick Jonas: We basically had a week break during the most recent Brothers tour. When we're on the road, we're actually most inspired to get out and write new music because you're on stage seeing how these songs are impacting people's lives. It's amazing to see music become a part of the fabric of people's lives, and so you just want to make more.
During that window, I had been really inspired by a lot of these life experiences I'd had over the last year, coming to New York, setting up life here with my family while I was doing the Broadway show, and then we ended up staying because it was more convenient just based on the tour routing and everything else. Our life got really small and simple, and it was just the time I had with my wife and my daughter, some of these experiences in the city, and then just things I'd been wanting to write about for a long time that I was finally able to put pen to paper on.
A big piece of that was finding the right collaborators. I got to work with JP Saxe on a lot of this record, who I met by way of seeing a video he had posted that really hit me where he mentioned that he would basically have to sell 20,000 more tickets or he'd have to cancel this tour. I was taken aback by his honesty and his vulnerability and messaged him, and then he ended up being a special guest on our Toronto show. I asked him if he wanted to come to this writing camp, and thankfully he said yes. And so finding those missing pieces and putting it all together was really the unlock.
The Sunday Best cover artwork showcases very simply two very important parts of your personal life, the Dexcom G7 continuous glucose monitor on your arm and the three handprints on the wall that look like they came from you, your wife Priyanka and daughter Malti. How did you decide on this album artwork and include those specific elements?
I really wanted the album cover to feel like you're looking into my life. I always had this idea of looking in the mirror and just the questions we all ask ourselves every day — am I being the best version of myself today? Am I being hard on myself? Am I being nice?
All that is really represented in the lyrics of “Gut Punch,” but there's other elements in there that were really important to me, the handprints being one. I am a husband and a father now, and it's a huge part of where I draw inspiration from, so that was important to include. And then it just happened that I was obviously wearing the Dexcom as I do every day. There was never a conversation about not having it in there just because it's another aspect of who I am. It's part of the DNA of my life and something that, I think, gives the person looking at this image a better idea of who I am.
I'm really glad it's there. It also continues to create awareness about something that is really revolutionary and done a ton to improve my life and so many other people's lives living with diabetes.
You've lived with type 1 diabetes since you were 13. But I feel like a lot of fans, myself included, learned around the A Little Bit Longer album when you started writing about it. You had learned to manage the disease with health technology by then, but I remember so many young fans at the time not knowing much about diabetes and thinking that you remained in critical condition. Did you feel that reaction at the time, and what did you make of it?
The conversation around awareness has always been one that's evolving every day. And the things that people know about diabetes or don't, are really revealing of the work that still needs to be done. I think back then there was just a lack of awareness, people thinking that it was critical and that it stays that way.
Diabetes is a manageable disease. However, without proper management, it can be really dangerous or even potentially fatal. So it's important to keep that in mind as we talk about the fact that it is manageable, and that there's a way to live a big and healthy, and wonderful life with it, but there are still some people globally that don't have access to life preserving and saving medication, and other technology.
Did you realize at a certain point, ""We have a lot of young listeners, and I want to inform them about diabetes and not just leave them feeling scared?""
From the moment I was released from the hospital, I was determined to get a real grip on how to manage the disease and live with it every day. But then once I felt comfortable, which was pretty soon after that, to be able to use this, at the time, fairly small platform, but to use whatever platform I had to be able to speak about it and try to encourage others going through an experience like it or directly related to diabetes.
When I was in the hospital, there was nobody that I could look at and say, ""Oh, they're living with diabetes. They're doing just fine."" It became important for me to be a part of that conversation, and hopefully the next 13-year-old kid sitting in the hospital room feeling discouraged and alone, and having a tough time with it would feel some encouragement.
And you're not the only one speaking about it now. Role Model has been open about his experience with type 1 diabetes, and fans have seen his continuous glucose monitor.
Yeah, it's been very exciting to see others come out and speak about their journey. It's a big, beautiful community with lots of interesting stories, and we can all pull inspiration and encouragement from each other. Role Model sharing his story is just amazing, and I'm happy for his success, and also he seems to be in great health, which is most important.
As your daughter, Malti, gets older, have you thought about how you'll discuss diabetes with her? Has she noticed your continuous glucose monitor?
Yeah, of course. She's seen the glucose monitor and my insulin pump. There was actually a fan on the tour who gifted me a diabetes coloring book. Basically, it's an educational coloring book for young diabetics, but also for others to learn about not just the disease, but some of the things that someone might see at that age and not fully understand yet, but it just helped start the conversation.
I was really blown away by that, and I gave that to her to color, and she made the connections of the insulin pump or the CGM [continuous glucose monitor]. We're always thinking it's best just to be honest and transparent, and find a way to articulate it so she has the information and the facts, and is surrounded by love and care in the way that we communicate so that there's nothing that's ever scary or that might stress her out.
It's a normal thing, and it's just something Dad lives with, and that's what it is.
There's also a song on the album in your daughter's honor, “Princesses.” Can you tell me the story behind that song?
My daughter loves princesses and loves to play princesses. The day we wrote that song, I'd come in. Me, JP Saxe and [Jeff “Gitty” Gitelman] were writing a different song. And then basically I went to the bathroom, came back and was like, ""Wait, can we just try something and just take a swing and see?"" I didn't know if it was something they would connect with, but I said, “I have this title, ‘Princesses,’” and they both stood up straight and were like, ""Yes, let's do that.""
The verses are just speaking about how I see her and how she sees the world, and the chorus is that desire to just play princesses and stay stuck in that moment with her forever if I could.",nick-jonas-reveals-how-a-fan-helped-him-teach-daug,"Jonas tells PEOPLE about creating his new album 'Sunday Best' amid the Jonas Brothers’ busy tour schedule and offering fans insight into his personal life

Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi are celebrating the former talk show host’s 68th birthday by dancing in a gorgeous garden.
On Friday, Feb. 6, DeGeneres took to social media to share a new clip of the couple lip syncing to BT Express’ “Do It (Til You’re Satisfied).” In the video, DeGeneres wears a rainbow-colored suit jacket, large sunglasses with pink frames, and a hat in the shape of a birthday cake.
Meanwhile, the Arrested Development alum, 53, wears a white cowboy hat and sunglasses with seashells and a starfish while playing the tambourine, all set against a lush backdrop of pristine landscaping and palm trees.
“6-7 is out. 6-8 is in,” the comedian writes in her caption, referencing the viral phrase.

The post comes shortly after PEOPLE confirmed that Degeneres had purchased a new Southern California property.
“She’s not moving back to the U.S. but will continue to split her time between both the U.K. and Montecito,” an insider previously told PEOPLE. 

The pair had relocated to the rural Cotswolds area of south central England in November 2024, and shared dispatches of their life there living on a farm with their animals on social media.
When the couple first relocated abroad, they lived in a home that they purchased in the spring of 2024. The Wall Street Journal reported they only lived there for a month before a series of extensive renovations. DeGeneres and de Rossi later relisted the home for $30 million in July 2024. The stars subsequently moved into another property better suited for de Rossi’s horses. 

Locals who used to see the couple around their Cotswolds estate regularly told PEOPLE they haven’t seen DeGeneres “in ages,” and a local pub source says she hasn’t been in for “several months.”
Another source added that DeGeneres was often spotted out in their village over the summer, but hasn’t been seen since. “She always looked friendly but nobody ever approached her and it was just another celeb to them.” 
The Cotswolds is home to numerous A-list stars such as the Beckhams, model Kate Moss and actor Hugh Grant. 
Back in July 2025, DeGeneres confirmed to the BBC that she and her wife permanently moved to England because Donald Trump was re-elected as president in 2024. She added that de Rossi was “living her dream"" as an avid horse lover in the English countryside.

""I always have to. Usually, it's a plush toy,"" says the proud uncle. ""I'll go somewhere. I'll be like, 'I'm going to Africa. What animal do you want? What do you want me to bring back?' And she'll be like, 'A hippopotamus.'""

As for what animal Irwin is going to bring back this time?
""Ooh, she's in a whale phase right now,"" he shares. ""We may have to go the whale route.""
Irwin and his niece have a close bond. When he was competing on Dancing with the Stars, his sister Bindi Irwin brought her daughter and husband, Chandler Powell, to Los Angeles to cheer him on. Grace even got to attend one of her uncle's rehearsals.
Back in November, Bindi shared a sweet photo of her daughter Grace at Robert's rehearsal for the dancing competition series. In the adorable picture, Grace could be seen wearing a dark green sparkly dress with a green ribbon, posing with her arms over her head.
Bindi, who won season 21 of the reality dance show with partner Derek Hough, smiled with her arm around Robert, who crouched down next to his dancing partner, Witney Carson. ""Celebrating 20 years of @dancingwiththestars. So incredibly special to bring Grace to the rehearsal studio,"" Bindi wrote in the caption.
""Her favourite part? 'Dance Class' with Witney and Uncle Robert. 🥹 My. Heart. #TeamIrWINit,"" she added.
At the end of September, Bindi shared a series of photos on Instagram ahead of attending a live taping of DWTS. In one sweet photo, Bindi and Powell posed with Grace in front of a multicolored mural.
Other photos showed just the mom and her daughter twirling together alone. Bindi wore a baby pink dress with flowers on the bodice, matching her daughter Grace's mini version. The two posed together for photos, smiling and dancing.

Amaya Espinal seems to be off the market.
The Love Island USA season 7 winner soft-launched a new man on her Instagram Stories in a series of posts shared on Friday, Feb. 6.
The 26-year-old posted a video of two massive bouquets of roses, calling them an ""early"" Valentine's Day gift, and she wrote, ""Mi bebe surprised me.""
She also shared a selfie of herself posing with the two bouquets, along with a shot that featured her new boyfriend. Espinal posed with a peace sign as her new partner stood behind her, and though his face wasn't in the frame, his tattooed arms were on display behind her.
""Spa dates,"" she captioned the shot.
Espinal teased that she has a new love interest in her life on the red carpet at the American Heart Association Red Dress Collection Concert on Jan. 29.
""The way I protect my mind, my peace, my heart is just by knowing what's real and knowing what's not. I feel like, especially since we're so glued to the phone, we could sometimes digest things that are not meant to be digested and read too much into things,"" she told PEOPLE. ""So I know when to turn my phone off, I know when I need to call my mom, call my manager, call my boyfriend to vent to. I think it's very important to know when your boundaries have to stop, you know.""
She also teased her Valentine's Day plans with her new beau, as she said, ""Me and my boyfriend, we are definitely going to be celebrating Valentine's Day together.""

Espinal left the Love Island villa in July with Bryan Arenales, and the pair made things exclusive before being crowned the winners.
She confirmed her split from Arenales the following month. “My papayas - Bryan and I are no longer together,” she wrote on her Instagram Stories on Aug. 27.
“After leaving the villa, it became very clear that we were on two different journeys. Our visions didn’t align and relationships are supposed to be a team sport. You don’t have to drink the whole sea to know it’s salty. All love here and I truly wish him the best.""
Just one day later, she told PEOPLE the split was ""something I am still processing.""
""But, I am very optimistic and very hopeful for the future,"" she said. ""And I'm just happy to have such a large amount of support around me.""",love-islands-amaya-espinal-soft-launches-new-boyfr,"The 'Love Island USA' season 7 winners split in August, and Espinal, 26, teased a new beau as she showed off some romantic early Valentine's Day gifts

Amazon has long been a hub of must-have fashion deals, but an exciting new brand drop just took the already-impressive selection up a notch. 
Everlane launched a storefront on Amazon with its most popular clothes, shoes, and accessories. And with spring just around the corner, there’s never been a better time to stock up on easy-to-layer tees, versatile button-down shirts, and lightweight pants — especially while many pieces are on sale for up to 64 percent off. Keep scrolling for the best deals on Everlane basics, as well as full-price but hard-to-ignore favorites.
Whether you’re heading into the office or having a relaxed day at home, these cotton-and-linen-blend pants make for a comfortable option. They have a high-rise waist with adjustable buttoned sides, trendy patch pockets, and a curved silhouette that tapers at the ankle, perfect for pairing with a black T-shirt and loafers.
“This sweater completely changed my expectations for what a luxury knit can feel like,” said a five-star reviewer, who received the pullover for free. Choose from eight solid colors, including taupe, gray, and moss green, as well as sizes XXS–XXL.
Look polished without feeling restricted in this Oxford shirt, made from soft cotton and designed with a relaxed fit. Fully tuck it into a pair of trousers with a belt, half-tuck it into a pencil skirt, or wear it loose with a pair of jeans.
Wear these leggings for yoga sessions, running errands, and lounging at home. They’re made from soft, sweat-wicking, and breathable material with light compression, and they can be thrown in the washing machine at the end of the day. Not to mention, they come in both standard and short inseams, making them a perfect fit for petite shoppers. 
Cold weather is no match for this insulated puffer jacket, made from recycled down with a water-resistant outer layer. Choose from five colors, including a versatile dark green, classic black, and light beige. 
Style this classic crewneck T-shirt with everything from shorts to jeans, or use it as a base layer under your sweater on chilly days. Plus, a reviewer confirmed that the “fabric is light, but substantial enough that it is not see-through.” 
These wide-leg pants have a high-rise waist, angled front pockets, back patch pockets, and a trendy, relaxed cut that works for whatever your day has in store. Better yet, you can get them for 40 percent off their typical price.
A bit more of a splurge pick, this half-zip sweater adds sophistication to every look. Made from 100 percent Merino wool, it’s warm, polished, and looks great worn over a button-up shirt or long-sleeve tee.
Take the day off in joggers that combine a relaxed fit with a luxurious feel. Ideal for a lazy Sunday, they have an elastic waist with a drawstring closure and slanted pockets that are big enough to store your phone.
Thanks to its slim-fitting silhouette, this long-sleeve cotton tee easily tucks into jeans, pants, and skirts. Plus, it folds up nicely in a suitcase without worrying about wrinkles once you reach your destination.","everlane-just-landed-on-amazon,-and-its-most-popul","If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation.

The groundhog may have seen his shadow this year, but I’m manifesting an early spring. 
I know I’m not alone in hoping the sunshine comes sooner rather than later, since I’ve noticed so many celebs wearing spring-coded, light-wash jeans recently — proving that there’s no need to wait until the weather warms up to bring out the style. Throw them on with a white tee and long black coat like Jennifer Lawrence, add on a tweed blazer á la Joanna Gaines, or keep the look casual like Gwyneth Paltrow with an oversized hoodie.
Ready for your denim wardrobe to see the light? I rounded up eight pairs of light-wash jeans on Amazon from brands like Gap, Joe’s Jeans, Levi’s, and Rag & Bone, starting at $29.
If you love the ripped knees on Gaines’ jeans, try this similar, vintage-inspired pair with a relaxed, wide-leg silhouette, low-rise waist, and double-button fly. The pants come in sizes 23–34 with short and standard lengths available.
Lawrence’s light-wash jeans had ultra-wide, flared hems, and these jeans are a close lookalike. “If you need a confidence boost, grab these,” one shopper raved. “These jeans had me walking around with a little extra pep … they hug in the right places, smooth out what needs smoothing, and the flare is chef’s kiss.”
Paltrow already convinced me to buy a fuzzy sweater and comfy clogs, so it’s no surprise that I want her light-wash jeans, too. These baggy jeans are just like hers, thanks to the loose fit and higher-rise waist.
Jennifer Aniston, Bette Midler, and Kelly Clarkson have all stepped out in cuffed jeans lately, so you’ll be right on trend when you slip into this similar pair. They have a high-rise waist, zip-and-button fly, and five-pocket styling, and they come in sizes 23–34.
If you’ve been on the fence about trying these viral-yet-pricey sweatpant jeans, two of our editors are here to set your mind at ease. “We were both immediately impressed by just how much the sweatpants look like jeans,” said senior shopping writer Averi Baudler. “Sure, it’s in the name, but we found them to be truly indistinguishable from classic denim.”
The moment I spotted these barrel jeans, I was transported back to my childhood — because I had such a similar pair in the ’80s. I love the super-light wash (although they also come in two darker washes that are calling my name), and the fact that you can create two different looks by wearing them cuffed or uncuffed.
As a 5-foot-tall shopper, I’m always on the lookout for petite jeans to fit my shorter frame — so I’m happy to report that these wide-leg jeans are available in a short inseam. (Don’t worry, they also come in standard and tall lengths). They’re designed to hit right at the ankles on most people.
From Sharon Stone to Courteney Cox, many of our favorite celebrities have deemed straight-leg jeans the “it” denim style right now. Try the trend for yourself in this light-wash pair from Khloé Kardashian’s brand with a high-rise waist, zip-and-button fly, and five-pocket styling.",jennifer-lawrence-and-gwyneth-paltrow-just-wore-th,"If you click on links we provide, we may receive compensation.

Feel free to thank me in advance: I put my shopping prowess to the test and discovered the best sales at Amazon right now. My search led me straight to the Amazon Deals hub, where I found staggering discounts on home, fashion, and beauty products.
Among my favorites are a carpet cleaner marked down a whopping 93 percent, a walking pad for $900 off, and buttery soft leggings for under $10. Below, shop the best deals at Amazon right now. Prices are as little as $9. 
My walking pad seriously transformed my daily movement routine. Not only is it compact enough to slide into closets or under furniture, it also helps me reach my step count, even while I’m working from home. If you haven’t sprung for one yet, take this as your sign — this walking pad is marked down by $900. One buyer succinctly described it as “smooth, quiet, and easy to use.” Others praise it for its easy assembly (simply plug it in once unwrapped) and slim design. 
Using the combined power of spray, brush, and suction functions, this carpet cleaner makes quick work of unfortunate messes. Better yet, it can also be used to clean upholstery, such as couches and car interiors. “The machine is no louder than a vacuum cleaner and light enough to pick up [and] move to where it is needed,” according to one shopper.
Activewear prices have gotten out of hand, which is why I’ve made it my personal mission to track down budget-friendly options like these dark brown, high-waisted leggings that are only $9. One customer compared them to Lululemon leggings as they feel “like a second skin and move with you without riding down.” Another praised the “buttery soft” material. 
Tired of your bras pinching and constricting you throughout the day? This wireless bra is the answer. The undergarment is lightly padded and constructed with breathable material, so it offers gentle support. Reviewers rave over the bra’s softness and comfort. A big bonus is that the bra’s straps can be converted into a razorback style.

EJAE, AUDREY NUNA and REI AMI — the three artists responsible for bringing viral song ""Golden"" to life in Netflix's hit animated film KPop Demon Hunters — are taking PEOPLE behind the scenes of their success.
""It literally changed the world, and it also changed mine,"" says REI AMI of the movie, which smashed records when it premiered last summer.
""The day it came out, June 20th, I remember getting off a plane and my phone was just blowing up,"" says EJAE. ""And my fiancé loves Reddit, and his Reddit posts were all about KPop Demon Hunters. He was like 'Babe, I think this is getting pretty viral right now.'""

""I thought this was pretty niche,"" admits AUDREY NUNA. ""I know that K-pop groups and K-pop has had such global support for a long time now... but I just didn't think that it was going to become so mainstream the way that it has.""
And, when asked to describe the recording process for Kpop Demon Hunters, each of the three women had different answers.
""Challenging,"" says AUDREY NUNA.
""Weirdly invigorating,"" added EJAE.
In the film, EJAE, AUDREY NUNA, and REI AMI sing for the roles of Rumi (Arden Cho), Mira (May Hong), and Zoey (Ji-young Yoo), respectively.
""Golden"" scored three nominations at this year's Grammys: Song of the Year, Best Pop Duo/Group Performance and Best Song Written for Visual Media, while the entire soundtrack for KPop Demon Hunters was nominated for Best Compilation Soundtrack For Visual Media.
At Sunday's awards, it won for Best Song Written for Visual Media.
After learning of their Grammy nominations in November, the HUNTR/X girl group told PEOPLE that they were ecstatic.
""We all screamed,"" AUDREY NUNA said of how the trio, who was on zoom together for the news, reacted.

For EJAE, who is one of the cowriters for ""Golden"" (alongside Mark Sonnenblick), the recognition speaks to a broader conversation around representation.
""I'm just so proud to be Korean because growing up in America, too, I felt ashamed being Korean at one point. I felt ostracized, and so I'm just happy to be a part of this incredible cultural phenomenon to be able to show off our country,"" she previously told PEOPLE.
KPop Demon Hunters quickly became the most-watched animated movie on Netflix after its debut in June 2025. It's also the platform’s most popular film of all time with over 236 million views and counting.
The film's soundtrack made just as big a wave when it debuted at No. 1 on Billboard’s Soundtracks chart and No. 8 on the all-genre Billboard 200. It also became the first soundtrack with four simultaneous Top 10 songs on the Billboard Hot 100.

The investigation began with a 911 call in which a woman told the dispatcher that Quentin was threatening to kill her and kill their son. (Police did not name the woman, but she was identified by the Las Vegas Review-Journal, News13 and in a GoFundMe as Raneka Pate.)
Pate told responding officers that Quentin allegedly threatened her, saying, ""If you don't tell them to call this s--- off, and if they try to come up these stairs, I'm blowing the child's brains out, and I'm blowing mine out. You won't have neither one of us.""

In newly released bodycam footage, a man police identify as Quentin is seen walking toward officers while carrying his 3-year-old son, Kentre, in his left arm. Police say Quentin was pointing a gun at the child as he approached; when officers ordered him to drop the weapon, he did not deny having a gun and instead said he wanted to see Pate, according to police.

A shooting ensues, and it's not clear whether Quentin started the shooting or the officers.
Police allege Kentre died from close-range gunshot wounds to his head, and that he'd been shot by Quentin.

The child had been shot three times, per Peterson, and two of those shots were allegedly from Kentre's gun. Peterson said it has not been ""determined"" where the third shot came from.
Pate told the Review-Journal she watched from a patrol car as Quentin and Ketre were shot, and claimed Quentin was not armed when he approached police.
“There was a plethora of bullets,” she said.
Quentin died at the scene. Kentre died after being taken to a hospital.
“They are trying to play damage control, but they will pay for killing my son,” Pate claimed to the Review-Journal of LVMPD.

Quentin would've been charged with murder, several domestic violence-related offenses and child abuse had he lived, Peterson said.
The officers involved have been identified by LVMPD as 39-year-old Jonthan Low who has been with the department since 2019, and 26-year-old Daymon O'Donnell, who has been with LVMPD since 2024.  They have not been formally accused of any wrongdoing.
Low fired three rounds and O'Donnell fired two rounds during the incident, Peterson said.

Mystery surrounds the death of a Massachusetts man whose remains were discovered inside a trash can in South Carolina.
The body of David Hutchinson, 32, was found decomposing inside a trash can at a home on Pearl Street in Marion on Thursday, Jan. 29, per the Marion County Coroner, WMBF reported.
Authorities are investigating his death as a homicide, Marion Police Chief Tony Flowers told News13.
Hutchinson arrived in Marion in December, allegedly after a woman he allegedly met online told him he could find a well-paying job in the area, Flowers said, WMBF reported. He was scheduled to return to Massachusetts in early January — but when he didn’t return home, his family alerted police.
In an interview with ABC4, Flowers alleged there were potentially 12 persons of interest in the case.

""It could be 12,” he said. “I don't know how many was involved. Because this house he was supposedly at, it is people in and out of the house all the time. So, there's no rhyme or reason to who lives there, who doesn't. So, we don't know how all how many people were there when this happened. If it actually happened inside the house, outside the house, in the area.""
On Jan. 30, Jaida Braddy, 41, was arrested and charged with accessory after the fact to a felony in connection with Hutchinson's death and is being held on a $15,000 surety bond, according to inmate records.
“David isn’t just a drifter who showed up in town, or another statistic,” his brother told News13.  “He’s a son, a brother, a cousin. An uncle and a friend to a lot of people up here who loved him tremendously. We prayed this story would have a better ending, and we’ll miss him so much.”
“Naive and too trusting, but a good kid who made bad decisions at times, and this time he sadly had to pay the ultimate price for it,” he added.
According to a GoFundMe page, Hutchinson, a barber, had a ""kind heart and the biggest personality. He was loved by all those who knew him and friendly to those who didn’t.""",he-met-a-woman-online-and-had-hopes-for-a-well-pay,"David Hutchinson, 32, was found dead inside a trash can on Jan. 29

An Alabama woman was sentenced to life in prison for her role in the death of a woman who was kidnapped and pushed off a cliff.
Loretta Carr was also sentenced to 20 additional years for kidnapping in connection with the 2021 death of 37-year-old Mary Beth Isbell, the District Attorney for the Ninth Judicial Circuit announced on Friday, Feb. 6.
Carr pleaded guilty to first-degree kidnapping and murder on Thursday, Feb. 5, AL.com reported, citing court records. 
Carr’s daughter Jessie Kelly pleaded guilty to murder in August 2025 and was sentenced to 40 years in prison, per WAFF.
According to prosecutors, Carr and Kelly went to Isbell’s home to “confront her because of a relationship she had with Carr’s significant other” on Oct. 18, 2021. The two allegedly attacked Isbell, took her against her will and dragged her inside a vehicle, prosecutors said, citing statements and forensic evidence discovered at Isbell’s residence.
Later that night, they drove to Wolf Creek Overlook at Little River Canyon in Fort Payne where Carr “tied herself with a rope to the barrier at the overlook, forced Isbell to climb over the barrier, and then forced her off the side of the canyon,” per a Ninth Judicial Circuit press release.
DeKalb County Sheriff's Office; Cherokee County Sheriff's Office
Isbell’s body was discovered two years later in the canyon beneath the overlook.

Isbell was reported missing in December 2021, per ABC31.

“This is an example of a senseless act destroying a family,” prosecutor Summer Summerford said in the press release. “A mother is left without a daughter, sisters are left without their sibling, and a son is left without his mother.""
""This family has been through so much, but they have walked with us and law enforcement throughout this process and have been so responsive and helpful. Please continue to pray for this family as they continue to figure out how to go through life without their loved one.”
Isbell owned her own remodeling business and was the mother of a teen boy, her family said, according to ABC31.","a-woman-vanished-for-2-years.-now,-someone-she-kne","Loretta Carr was sentenced to life in prison plus 20 years for murder and kidnapping in the death of 37-year-old Mary Beth Isbell

Authorities in southeastern Texas have arrested a man they accuse of kidnapping a girl following a dramatic rescue operation at a hotel.
Graham Michael Dunn, 27, was arrested on several charges, including sexual assault of a child, in connection with the alleged abduction of a 12-year-old girl in Galveston, Texas, on Jan. 30, the Galveston Police Department said at a press briefing this week.
The child was reported missing in the evening on Jan. 30, Chief of Police Doug Balli said at the briefing on Thursday, Feb. 5.
Police believe the girl was walking her dog when she was ""encountered by Graham Dunn,"" who had pulled up in his car. Dunn allegedly got out of the vehicle and forced the child inside of it, before fleeing the area, Balli said.
Investigators followed an ""emergency ping"" on the girl's phone and located the ping at a hotel a few miles away.
Hotel staff initially had difficulty obtaining security footage, but later provided investigators with surveillance video that allegedly shows Dunn entering the hotel with the girl, the police said.
Officers then broke into a room and rescued the child before apprehending Dunn.
While no motive has been discussed about why the child was targeted, police allege Dunn used social media to ""lure"" the girl out.

Glenn Jackson will now likely face face prison time following the plea, which was reported by the Lexington Herald Leader, Fox 56 and LEX 18.
An Alford plea allows a defendant to maintain innocence while also admitting there is likely enough evidence for prosecutors to secure a conviction.
Ella Diebolt Jackson was reported missing in Richmond, Kent., by Glenn on Oct. 22, 2019, PEOPLE previously reported.
In 2020, Glenn was charged with murder and tampering with evidence in connection with the disappearance of Ella.
A week after Glenn was arrested, Ella's partial skeletal remains were found in a wooded area near a property he owned, per LEX 18.
At the time of her death, Ella and Glenn had a 5-year-old son together.
Ella’s ex-husband, Jason Hans, wrote on Facebook that he remained friends with her even after they divorced more than a decade before her death. He claimed that Ella had begun fearing for her safety in 2015.

Police believe they may have found a ""very promising"" TikTok video that could potentially lead them to six people in Missouri who have been missing since August 2023.
Ma’Kayla Wickerson, 28, and her now 5-year-old daughter, Malaiyah Wickerson, and Gerrielle German, 30, and her 5-year-old daughter Ashton Mitchell haven't been heard from in years, KTVI's Fox 2 reported. Mikayla Thompson, 27, and Naaman Williams, 32, are also missing.
The missing individuals had been living in a rented home in Berkeley, Mo., near St. Louis Lambert International Airport, PEOPLE previously reported. The group was last seen at a hotel on Aug. 13, 2023, in Florissant, Mo. and no one has heard from them since, Berkeley Police Major Steve Runge said.
Runge told PEOPLE in January 2024 that the four missing adults were believed to be part of a cult allegedly revolving around Rashad Jamal, who was convicted of child molestation charges in 2023 and is currently serving a prison sentence in Georgia.
In recent years, Jamal has amassed thousands of followers on social media with his spiritual teachings, operating what he calls the University of Cosmic Intelligence, which according to its website is “geared toward enlightening and illuminating minds” of Black and Latino people. 
Speaking to the St. Louis Post-Dispatch from prison, Jamal previously denied being a cult leader and maintained his innocence in his child molestation case. 
Runge has now told Fox 2 that police are aware of a new TikTok clip appearing to feature one of the women, which he's described as ""very promising.""
Runge told PEOPLE via email that the video shows Gerielle German.
""We have submitted a legal demand to [TikTok] for the release of user data associated with that user page, as well [as] an IP location for any recent posts,"" he told PEOPLE.
Berkeley Police detective, Sergeant George Ervin, questioned about the video, “Was it actually our missing person? Or is this some copycat just using a picture?” per Fox 2. Ervin is now working to serve TikTok with a warrant to find the account holder.
“I know that it seems like some stuff you’d see fresh out of a movie in Hollywood, but this is real life. These people are missing,” Ervin told the station.
“I really hope we find them,” Runge added, per the outlet. “I’ve promised the families that we will not give up, and we haven’t given up.”
Runge told Fox 2 of the group's disappearance, “There’s no footprint whatsoever, no current digital footprint."" He's obtained a personal record number of search warrants for the case.
“We’re trying to find any lead,” Runge told the station, adding, “Common places they went, rental cars, phone records out of state, out of the country, trying to find any ties to give us a lead as to where they are.”
Before their disappearance, neighbors reported seeing some of the missing six on the roof of their rental home, naked, per Fox 2.
“Really off the grid kind of stuff,” Runge told the outlet. “How to prepare for doomsday. A lot of it, the end of the world is coming. And they had a very solid belief that we’re not from here. We’re not from this planet.”
“We recovered a diary from one of the people that went missing, and the writings in that diary are something you would see with brainwashing, just repetitive, 'I am a god, I am a god, I am a god,'” Runge said, per Fox 2.
Runge previously told PEOPLE that some of Rashad Jamal’s followers, whom he said include three of the missing adults, had changed their names in honor of those they believe to be spiritual gods or goddesses. Williams is also known as Anubis Aramean, Thompson goes by Antu Anum Ahmat, while Wickerson is Intuahma Aquama Auntil, according to Berkeley Police. 
Police also said that the Berkeley quartet had allegedly been exhibiting some of the other followers’ behaviors: total disconnection from family and loved ones, a desire to go off the grid, quitting their jobs and embracing sovereign citizenship, among other behaviors.
“It’s confusing, the internet is [the group's] home,” Runge said in January 2024. “It’s not like, ‘Okay, we’re going to go to St. Louis.’ No, the internet is its home. [Jamal] has 90,000 followers.”
Runge previously said that Wickerson’s mother, Cartisha Morgan, had called police on Aug. 12, 2023, to say she was worried about her daughter, whom she hadn't heard from. 
Days later, detectives began investigating and searched the Berkeley home and found no signs of foul play. Runge said they discovered the group’s Facebook profiles, which contained references to Jamal and were once extremely active and public before the activity abruptly stopped.
While Wickerson, who according to her LinkedIn profile once worked for JP Morgan Chase, and Thompson are both from St. Louis, Williams is from Washington D.C., while German is originally from Lake Horn, Miss., near Memphis.
Thompson, like the other two women, is also the mother of a young child whom she left behind with her mother, according to Runge.
Morgan previously told PEOPLE in January 2024 that she was worried about her daughter and granddaughter, saying that she believed Wickerson had been suffering from depression following the birth of her daughter, and that she was preyed upon as a result.
“I'm not doing so well, but I'm just holding on by my faith,” Morgan told PEOPLE at the time. “I just wish that people are made aware of this.”

Wickerson had been living with her mother while she was pregnant before moving out in November 2022. Morgan last heard from her daughter in March 2023.
Morgan recalled Wickerson telling her she was feeling overwhelmed as a mother, adding that she thinks her daughter was crying out for help and that there were signs she wasn't okay.
Calling her daughter's disappearance “astonishing,” because she was very family-oriented, Morgan previously told PEOPLE, “Ma’Kayla, we love you and we want the best for you. We would like for her to come back home. We are going to get her the help that we need. Your spiritual journey is your spiritual journey. If you want to be your best self, we understand that, but we love you and we just want you to come back home.”",6-people-tied-to-an-online-cult-vanished-in-august,"A man, three women and two young children haven't been heard from since they went missing from their rented home in Berkeley, Missouri, over two years ago

A Florida teenager is accused of plotting a mass shooting in an online extremist chatroom, prompting a search that uncovered child pornography on his devices.
Hillsborough County Sheriff Chad Chronister said in a Facebook video briefing that the teen was arrested Jan. 31 after investigators received a tip that he had access to weapons and was threatening violence.
The teen had been active in an online chatroom tied to violent extremism and discussed shooting up a nearby church, though he did not specify which one, Chronister said. Investigators linked the home to an active child exploitation probe coming from the same IP address, Chronister said.

Detectives executed a search warrant at the residence, where they recovered multiple firearms and ammunition, along with electronic devices containing child sex abuse material, Chronister said during the briefing. He added that while most weapons were secured in a safe, one firearm was found in the father’s nightstand that the teen “easily could have had access to.”
Chronister said they discovered 14 ""extremely graphic, disturbing"" images ""where individuals were inflicting violence towards infants and toddlers"" — images he told reporters were ""too graphic and too disturbing to discuss,"" because they ""would keep all of you up at night.""

Investigators also linked the teen to a ""neo-Nazi Satanic group"" known as Temple of Love, which promotes violence as a form of spiritual enlightenment, Chronister said. During questioning, the teen appeared unbothered and told deputies he was “trying to be edgy,” Chronister said.
""The age of the individual involved does not lessen the seriousness of these crimes,” Chronister said. “Threats of mass violence and the exploitation of children demand immediate action, and we will always move swiftly to protect lives and hold those responsible accountable.”
The teen is charged as a juvenile with written or electronic threat to conduct a mass shooting or act of terrorism, in-state transmission of child pornography by electronic device, 14 counts of solicitation or possession of child pornography involving 10 or more images and two counts of unlawful use of a two-way communications device, per the briefing.
Chronister said additional charges could follow as forensic exams of the teen’s devices continue. The State Attorney’s Office will determine whether he will ultimately be charged as an adult.

More than a year after human remains were discovered, authorities have identified them as a 43-year-old man who disappeared from a Native American reservation.
The Glacier County Sheriff’s Office said in a release that after a year-and-a-half investigation led by Deputy Jolee Bullshoe, the remains were positively identified as Gabriel Calfbossribs.
The sheriff’s office said officers responded to a report of human remains found in the vicinity of the Boarding School area on September 28, 2024. 
“Deputy Bullshoe devoted numerous hours to the case and worked closely with the Montana State Crime Labs and the University of North Texas to obtain a DNA match,” authorities said.
The cause and manner of Calfbossribs' death are currently undetermined, according to the sheriff’s office. 
Calfbossribs had been missing since the summer of 2024 from the Blackfeet Reservation in northwest Montana, according to authorities.
“After a while (we) haven’t got no contact with him, haven't seen him and stuff,” Daniel Calfbossribs, Gabriel’s uncle, told NBC Montana in May. “And then start hearing stories that there was a gun pulled on him, so that's what really got me start worrying.”
Rumors of Calfbossribs’ possible whereabouts had his family searching abandoned buildings and a dump.
“It hasn’t been easy hearing those stories, it hasn’t been easy thinking about what could have happened or how it happened, but it doesn’t stop us,” Marla Nightgun, Gabriel’s cousin, also told the outlet.

Kate Middleton debuted a new piece of jewelry just weeks after her 44th birthday, raising speculation that it could be a birthday gift from Prince William.
On Feb. 5, the Prince and Princess of Wales held a meeting with Archbishop Sarah Mullally, the new Archbishop of Canterbury, at Lambeth Palace in London. Mullally is the first female Archbishop of Canterbury in the Church of England's 1,428-year history, and Princess Kate slipped on a new necklace for the occasion.
The Princess of Wales brought the glimmer with a gold heart pendant on a paper clip chain, widely identified as by Daniella Draper. 
Kate's necklace looked like the British brand's Gold Keeper's Heart Trace Chain Necklace, which retails beginning at $2,200 without personalization.
Andrew Parsons / Kensington Palace
The Gold Keeper's Heart Trace Chain Necklace is handmade in England with recycled 9ct yellow gold. According to the jeweler, the piece symbolizes ""love and connection"" and ""captures the essence of affection, serving as a meaningful reminder of your everlasting love.""
Princess Kate's heart pendant also appeared to be engraved, though the personalization was difficult to discern.
The Princess of Wales turned 44 on Jan. 9 and debuted the necklace one month later, sparking the thought that it could be a birthday present.
Prince William, 43, has previously given his wife meaningful jewelry through the years, including the iconic sapphire and diamond engagement ring that previously belonged to his late mother, Princess Diana. It is also widely believed that he gave her a white gold and diamond Annoushka eternity ring following the birth of their first child, Prince George, now 12, and she continues to wear the ring often today.
The Princess of Wales has several Daniella Draper necklaces in her collection, personalized with the initials of her children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, 10, and Prince Louis, 7. Perhaps her best-known necklace from the label is her Gold Diamond Midnight Moon Necklace, engraved with G, C and L and three diamond stars.

Meghan Markle's latest Instagram video gave royal fans a look at some of Prince Harry's cherished mementos.
The Duchess of Sussex, 44, posted a video to her Instagram Stories on Thursday, Feb. 5, celebrating the launch of her As ever brand's most recent collaboration with luxury chocolatier Compartés. In the clip, she surprised Harry, 41, in his office at their Montecito, Calif., home, where he was seated barefoot at his desk, with the family's rescue beagle, Mia, resting in a basket nearby.
Meghan presented the new collection of four flavors to her husband, who exclaimed, ""Ooh, yes please,"" as he selected the white chocolate bar with flower sprinkles and hemp hearts.
""White chocolate? You got it,"" Meghan commented before Harry replied, ""Thank you, love you."" 
The exchange also provided a look at Harry's office decor, which features a few items of sentimental value.
One of the most visible in the clip is a glass display case featuring what appears to be a collection of military patches. The patches were reportedly gifted to the prince by the Ukrainian team from the Invictus Games, the international adaptive sports tournament for veterans and service personnel that Harry, a veteran of the British Army, founded in 2014.
Displayed on the wall just behind Harry is a card that reads ""Love You Papa"" on the front, likely a joint gift from Harry and Meghan's children, Prince Archie, 6, and Princess Lilibet, 4, who refer to him by the moniker.
Next to the card is a photo that, while just barely visible in the video, eagle-eyed royal fans recognized as a portrait of Harry with his beloved late mother, Princess Diana.
The image of Diana — in a white swimsuit, short-cropped hair held back by sunglasses atop her head, a beaming young Harry hugging her from behind — is featured in the Duke of Sussex's 2023 memoir, Spare. He included the personal pic at the end of the prologue, in which he writes lovingly about his late mother.
""Although my mother was a princess, named after a goddess, both those terms always felt weak, inadequate. People routinely compared her to icons and saints, from Nelson Mandela to Mother Teresa to Joan of Arc, but every such comparison, while lofty and loving, also felt wide of the mark. The most recognizable woman on the planet, one of the most beloved, my mother was simply indescribable; that was the plain truth,"" Harry wrote.
""And yet…how could someone so far beyond everyday language remain so real, so palpably present, so exquisitely vivid in my mind? How was it possible that I could see her, clear as the swan skimming towards me on that indigo lake? How could I hear her laughter, loud as the songbirds in the bare trees—still? There was so much I didn’t remember, because I was so young when she died, but the greater miracle was all that I did. Her devastating smile, her vulnerable eyes, her childlike love of movies and music and clothes and sweets—and us. Oh how she loved my brother and me. Obsessively, she once confessed to an interviewer. Well, Mummy…vice versa.""

Prince Harry and Meghan moved their family to Montecito in 2020, after stepping back from their roles as working royals and amid the family rift that Harry details in Spare.
Meghan has shared some small details about their California abode, including the one feature that inspired her As ever logo: two palm trees in their backyard that connect at their base. In a 2022 interview with The Cut, Meghan shared how the trees caught Harry's eye when they first toured the house.
""One of the first things my husband saw when we walked around the house was those two palm trees,"" she said. ""See how they’re connected at the bottom? He goes, 'My love, it’s us.' ""

Crown Princess Mette-Marit of Norway is officially apologizing for her friendship with Jeffrey Epstein.
On Feb. 6, the Royal House of Norway released a new statement from the Crown Princess, 52. The update came one week after the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) published over three million additional pages related to the Epstein Files Transparency Act, including what appeared to be emails between Mette-Marit and Epstein that indicated a friendship. 
""I would like to express my deepest regret for my friendship with Jeffrey Epstein. It is important for me to apologize to all of you that I have disappointed,"" began the statement from Crown Princess Mette-Marit, translated into English. 
""Some of the content of the messages between Epstein and me does not represent the person I want to be. I also apologize for the situation that I have put the Royal Family in, especially the King and Queen,"" she continued, referring to her in-laws, King Harald and Queen Sonja.

Mette-Marit's apology was shared within a longer statement from the Royal House of Norway, which underscored her regret about her association with Epstein. The disgraced American financier was a convicted sex offender who died in prison while awaiting trial on federal sex trafficking charges in August 2019.
According to an English translation, the statement from the palace began, ""We understand the strong reactions people have to what has emerged in recent days. The Crown Princess strongly disavows Epstein's abuse and criminal acts. She is very sorry for not having understood early enough what kind of person he was.""
""The Crown Princess wants to tell about what happened and explain herself in more detail. She cannot do that now. The Crown Princess is in a very demanding situation,"" it continued. ""She hopes for understanding that she needs time to gather herself.""
The difficult predicament that the palace referenced could have been an allusion to the ongoing court case involving her son, Marius Borg Høiby. Marius, 29, is Crown Princess Mette-Marit's son from a relationship prior to her marriage to Crown Prince Haakon, and he headed to trial this week on Feb. 3 on 38 charges, including four counts of rape.  
On Tuesday, he pleaded not guilty to four counts of rape and one count of domestic violence, and pleaded guilty to offensive sexual behavior, speeding and driving without a valid license, Reuters said.
In December 2025, the palace also announced that the princess was being assessed for a lung transplant amid a ""clear worsening"" of her health. Mette-Marit has chronic pulmonary fibrosis, a lung disease that occurs when lung tissue becomes scarred, and lung transplants are an option for treatment.
The palace's Feb. 6 statement also outlined Crown Princess Mette-Marit's Jan. 31 mea culpa about regretting her contact with Epstein and detailed that she met Epstein in ""social contexts, most of them in the United States."" It also included Mette-Marit's December 2019 statement disavowing her links to Epstein, a remark she released after then-Prince Andrew announced his step back from his royal role following a damaging BBC interview about his ties to Epstein.
On Friday, Crown Prince Haakon, 52, spoke out to the press about the scandals affecting his family and his ongoing support for his wife. The future king of Norway ""asked a large press corps to gather"" before he spoke, opening up amid an official visit to Oslo Sami kindergarten, NRK reported.
""When there is a lot happening at once, as it has been for our family now, I am a little concerned that we must have the priorities in the right order,"" the outlet reported that Crown Prince Haakon said, per an English translation.  
""For me, the most important thing in recent days has been to take care of the flock. We support Marius in the situation he is in, we look after the other children – they must also be looked after – and I have to look after and take care of the Crown Princess,"" he continued. ""Fortunately, she takes care of me too.""
Haakon acknowledged the attention around Mette-Marit and stressed that she wanted to respond.

""The Crown Princess understands that there are many who want to hear from her. She would like to tell. But now she can't. And I also tell her that she is not allowed to,"" he said. ""She would like to tell more about the case, and we hope there is understanding that she needs some time.""
The prince's mention of children referenced Princess Ingrid Alexandra, 21, and Prince Sverre Magnus, 20, his daughter and son whom he shares with his wife.
At this time, Crown Prince Haakon is acting as regent while his father, King Harald, 88, is in Italy for the Winter Olympics.",norways-princess-mette-marit-apologizes-for-epstei,"""I would like to express my deepest regret for my friendship with Jeffrey Epstein,"" Crown Princess Mette-Marit began

King Charles unveiled a new royal residence in his documentary by opening the doors to Cluckingham Palace.
Finding Harmony: A King's Vision premiered globally on Amazon's Prime Video on Friday, Feb. 6, and a must-see moment shows the King, 77, stepping inside Cluckingham Palace, a chicken coop at his beloved Highgrove estate.
As seen in an official snippet of the documentary shared to Instagram, the rain boot-clad King brought a bucket of feed into Cluckingham Palace and left with a basket full of brown eggs.
""That's a good haul,"" someone behind the camera commented. 
""Well, the great thing is you give them something in return,"" the sovereign responded with a chuckle. ""At least they can peck about here, they love it,"" he added about the space for the birds.
Cluckingham Palace is a witty play on Buckingham Palace, the royal family's iconic residence in London, and the lighthearted moniker is reminiscent of the punny name of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's chicken coop at their home in Montecito, California.
The Duke and Duchess of Sussex have a chicken coop at their house called Archie's Chick Inn, nodding to the name of their son, Prince Archie, 6. Prince Harry, 41, and Meghan, 44, bought their home in Montecito in 2020 after stepping back from their royal roles in the U.K. and their daughter Princess Lilibet, 4, was born in California in 2021.
The world got a glimpse of Archie's Chick Inn during the couple's interview with Oprah Winfrey, which aired on CBS in March 2021. There, Oprah noticed the sign reading ""Archie's Chick Inn — established 2021"" for the coop housing hens rescued from a factory farm.
""I just love rescuing,"" Meghan said about the flock.

Though King Charles and Harry, his younger son, remain estranged amid a familial rift that became public when he and Meghan stepped back from their royal roles in 2020, old footage of the father and son is featured in Finding Harmony.
The documentary chronicles King Charles' lifelong commitment to the environment and includes a quick clip of Prince Harry fly fishing with his father as a young boy.
Finding Harmony: A King's Vision highlights the sovereign's work through The King's Foundation, the charity he founded in 1990 inspired by his philosophy of harmony, and is narrated by King's Foundation ambassador Kate Winslet.
King Charles and Queen Camilla attended the documentary's glam premiere at Windsor Castle on Jan. 28 in a special screening thought to be the first premiere in a royal residence.

Prince Harry happily accepted a tasty delivery from Meghan Markle!
On Feb. 5, the Duchess of Sussex, 44, posted a new video to her Instagram Stories that captured her delivering her husband chocolates from her As ever brand's collaboration with Compartés.
The video, filmed by Meghan, began with her walking with four of the As ever chocolate bars in a box and rolled to show the family's rescue beagle, Mia, resting in a basket at Harry's feet. 
The Duke of Sussex, 41, was barefoot as he sat at a desk with a laptop in a cozy office, with a case of what appeared to be military patches behind him, which were reportedly gifted to him by Ukraine's Invictus Games team. Prince Harry is a veteran of the British Army and the founding patron of the Invictus Games, an international adaptive sports tournament for veterans and service personnel.
Harry and Meghan greeted each other with, ""Hello,"" and he exclaimed, ""Ooh, yes please,"" when she handed him the box of bars.
""White chocolate? You got it,"" Meghan said, commenting on her husband's choice, as Harry said, ""Thank you, love you."" 
On Jan. 31, the Duchess of Sussex's As ever brand launched an expanded collaboration with Compartés chocolates featuring four flavors. As ever previously teamed up with the Los Angeles chocolatier for a pre-Christmas collection that quickly sold out in December 2025, and Prince Harry reached for the White Chocolate Bar with flower sprinkles and hemp hearts in the new video.

Meghan unveiled her As ever brand in March 2025 as a curated line of shelf-stable food products including jams, teas, and flower sprinkles, timed near the premiere of season one of her lifestyles show With Love, Meghan on Netflix.
The chocolate collab is As ever's latest venture and the Duchess of Sussex opened up to PEOPLE in 2025 about launching her brand and her hopes for it.

Halle Berry is crediting her famous pixie cut for helping her snag her first major television role in the 1980s.
Berry, 59, spoke on the Fri., Feb. 6 episode of Vogue's The Run-Through podcast.
Speaking about the pixie cut she wore for decades in the 1980s, '90s and beyond, the actress said the hairstyle ""defined my life and my career for a time.""
""Cutting my hair into a pixie actually got me my first acting job, so I have a love affair with that pixie,"" Berry added, referencing her first acting gig as Emily Franklin on the 1980’s sitcom Living Dolls. ""And I will go back to the pixie — when I'm ready to wear gray hair.""

The actress continued: ""I will go back to a short pixie. I will do that. I'm not there yet, but one day, I will go back to my pixie when I want to wear gray hair.""
""I want a gray pixie,"" she declared.

The actress has previously spoken about the iconic hairstyle, saying in a 2019 interview with InStyle, that it wasn’t until after she chopped off her long hair that she finally booked an acting gig.
“I think that was because the directors and producers actually saw me,” Berry said, while reflecting on past cover shoots for the fashion magazine’s 25th Anniversary Issue. “Before that, I had long hair like every other girl like me. When I got [that] haircut, I felt like my best self.”
Berry — who recently confirmed that she is engaged to musician Van Hunt — is a mom to two children: daughter Nahla Ariela Aubry, 17, whom she shares with ex-boyfriend Gabriel Aubry, and son Maceo-Robert Martinez, 12, whom she shares with ex-husband Olivier Martinez. She was first married to retired Major League Baseball player David Justice for four years in the 1990s, and then to singer/actor Eric Benét from 2001 to 2003. In 2013, Berry married French actor Martinez, now 60, but the couple split in 2015. Since 2020, Berry has been in a relationship with Hunt.

Julia Fox is once again proving herself to be a jack of all trades.
At the New York City premiere of her new film Idiotka on Thursday, Feb. 5, Fox's costar Anna Baryshnikov told PEOPLE that the Uncut Gems actress was highly involved in the styling of her character, Emma Wexler.
""She's incredible. Every day she walked on set, she helped really curate what she was wearing,"" said Baryshnikov, 33. ""She did her own makeup. The energy she brought to set was incredible.""
The actress added that Fox, 36, was "" so supportive"" of the movie's director, Nastasya Popov.
""I think it's a really big deal that she lends her talent and her name towards emerging artists of all kinds, emerging designers and emerging filmmakers,"" Baryshnikov continued. ""I just think she's one of our best.""
In the irreverent comedy, Baryshnikov plays Margarita, a disgraced fashion designer facing financial issues who enters a reality show with a six-figure cash prize to save her babushka’s West Hollywood apartment.

""But as the competition intensifies, slick producer Nicol (Camila Mendes) pushes her to spin her family’s struggle into spectacle, forcing Margarita to decide whether to play along or take control of her own narrative, one unhinged look at a time,"" reads an official synopsis.

Fox plays one of the reality show's judges, alongside Benito Skinner and Saweetie.
In October, the Down the Drain author, who has made headlines for her daring style choices, opened up to The Sunday Times about a shopping spree during which she spent over $60,000 on designer items in one trip.
""I used my man’s credit card in a mania, spent $68,000 in a night and bought hundreds of Chanel, YSL, Pucci, Mugler, Christian Lacroix, Alexander McQueen and Versace pieces,"" Fox said when asked about the priciest thing she's ever purchased.

However, the actress and model ended up getting rid of the items once she was single again.
""I had to sell them all when he dumped me,"" she shared.

Although Fox, who now identifies as pansexual, didn't name her then-partner, she did briefly touch upon her quick marriage to pilot Peter Artemiev, with whom she shares son Valentino, 4, when asked about an outfit she'll ""never forget.""
""I got married in Vegas on a whim in 2018,"" she recalled. ""I wore bedazzled Steve Madden shoes, which I’d bought the same day, and a white DaisyLtd sundress that I had in my luggage. He wore a red shirt with pin-up girls all over it and cowboy boots. It was perfect.""",anna-baryshnikov-says-idiotka-costar-julia-fox-‘di,"""The energy she brought to set was incredible,"" Baryshnikov told PEOPLE at the film's New York premiere

Chappell Roan's makeup artist is pulling back the curtain on the singer's shocking topless look at the 2026 Grammy Awards.
In a new interview with Allure,  makeup and special effects artist Sasha Glasser revealed exactly how her team pulled off the jaw-dropping red carpet illusion, which involved fake nipple rings that attached to Roan's custom sheer Mugler gown.
""The idea was for her to not be so naked,"" Glasser told the outlet.
The process began with prosthetic nipple covers from the brand Out of Kit. “It’s not like any other type of prosthetic because it has a sticky backing, like a Band-Aid, so you don’t have to glue it down,"" the artist explained. To ensure the covers stayed put, Glasser and her team (makeup artists Malina Stearns and Chelsea Delfino) also used Telesis glue, an extra-strong medical-grade prosthetic adhesive.
However, once the nipple rings were placed in the prosthetic, it ripped at the slightest tug. ""... That was scary,"" Glasser said. She decided to reinforce the nipple cover with power mesh, which worked like a charm.
""I cut a dime-size piece, glued it to the back of the prosthetic, and then we stuck the earring through both the prosthetic and the mesh,” she explained.
The final step was painting the prosthetic to perfectly match Roan's skin. Because this process had to be done while the nipple rings were already in place, Glasser kept the jewelry clean by covering them in bubblegum wrappers which she removed before clasping the dress.
Of the team's ingenuity, Glasser said, ""It helps when you have good prosthetics, but it’s also a testament to our skills that we’ve worked so long on perfecting.”

The prosthetics also explain how Roan, 27, was able to skirt a fine from CBS, which airs the Grammys. Per The Sun, the networks' guidelines state that attendees should avoid ""sheer, see-through clothing that could possibly expose female breast nipples.”

The Grammy winner arrived on the red carpet in a trompe l'oeil gown by Mugler consisting of a skin-tone bodice with faux nipple piercings and intricate tattoos. The custom creation, which draped sheer burgundy fabric from the faux piercings to the floor and featured a matching cape, was inspired by a runway design from Thierry Mugler’s spring 1998 ""Jeu de Paume"" couture collection.

Roan completed her Grammys look, curated by her longtime stylist Genesis Webb, with gold fine jewelry from Buccellati.

After the ""Good Luck, Babe!"" singer's faux-naked look made headlines, Roan responded to the flurry of commentary.
""Giggling because I don’t even think this is THAT outrageous of an outfit,"" the singer shared on Instagram in a Monday, Feb. 2 carousel post with photos of her look.
""The look’s actually so awesome and weird,"" Roan continued, adding, ""I recommend just exercising your free will it’s really fun and silly :D Thank you for having me @grammys and those who voted for me!!""",chappell-roans-makeup-artist-says-she-used-gum-wra,"Special effects artist Sasha Glasser says that Roan's nearly-naked moment is ""a testament to our skills that we’ve worked so long on perfecting""

No one is ever happy to get a jury summons in the mail, but that's especially true for one Connecticut dad when he realized the letter had his 4-year-old daughter's name on it.
Dr. Omar Ibrahimi tells PEOPLE that he came home on Monday, Feb. 1, after a long day, walked to the mailbox and started sorting through its contents. It was then he saw the letter from the state judicial department with the huge jury summons stamp.
“It’s never a good time to get one of those,” says Ibrahimi, a dermatologist specializing in laser surgery. “Then I saw the name on it was Zara.”
Ibrahimi texted his wife Sadia, 41, and told her the news — meanwhile, their preschooler, who heard the conversation, just wanted to know what exactly was going on.
Her dad decided to turn the situation into an impromptu little kid civics lesson.
Imbrahimi says he explained how you go into a room with 12 people who listen to something that happened and then decided if someone’s guilty or not guilty.
“She’s like, 'How am I supposed to do that? I’m just a baby!' ” Ibrahimi says. “She’s used that line to get out of stuff, but I think it was a pretty legitimate excuse this time.”
His wife tells PEOPLE they extended the lesson by asking Zara if her 12-year-old sister Sarah “was guilty or not guilty of sometimes being a bad sister.” Zara, she says, quickly proclaimed “Guilty!”

But then came the more difficult part: figuring out how to fix it.
He went to the website where prospective jurors are supposed to register and while there were a lot of forms, he says there were none that read: “We made a mistake, how do we excuse you?”
There was, however, a box asking for your highest level of education.
Obviously there was no preschool option so Ibrahimi opted for “Did not complete high school"" — then found a box where he could state the situation even more plainly, writing a message on behalf of his daughter.
“I wrote 'I am 4 years old and am in preschool. This is obviously some sort of mistake,' "" Ibrahimi recalls.
The family says they later received a notification from the judicial branch confirming the mistake and dismissing Zara from jury duty. 
Zara's parents tell PEOPLE that according to the jury administration's investigation, the error occurred because the revenue department, one of four sources used to generate jury lists, does not report age information.
Sadia Ibrahimi tells PEOPLE that her son Daniel, 8, is a little miffed about all the attention his little sister has been getting and wonders why he didn’t get a summons. 
As for big sister Sarah, she told her parents that if it had been her, she wouldn't have tried to get out of it.
“She said she would have shown up. She’s actually as tall as me and just looking at her, you might think she was old enough,” admits Sadia. 
However, her parents say that after this debacle, there's one thing they're convinced of more than ever: their household won't be able to escape jury duty for much longer.

A man has been reunited with his class ring 44 years after losing it on a beach in Mississippi as a high school senior.
""I was ecstatic, I couldn’t believe it,"" Darien Ladner, of Pass Christian told WLOX.
Ladner was visiting a local beach with friends in 1982 when the ring fell off his finger and into the sand, according to the outlet.
Although he and his pals quickly “started digging in the sand trying to find it,” that unintentionally caused the ring to sink deeper in the sand. 
An assistant principal from the school even tried to help find the ring with a metal detector, but the search was unsuccessful.
But the ring did not remain lost forever — 44 years later, Sammy Jewell found it while using a metal detector on the same beach during low tide.
The ring was located about a foot beneath the sand, according to WLOX.
So Jewell set out to find the ring’s owner and quickly made contact with Ladner, who found out the good news on the morning of Monday, Feb. 2.

Lottbrein and her husband, John Lottbrein, were already parents of two when they underwent fertility treatments so they could have a third child, according to a hospital press release. But during their first fetal scan, they learned they weren't just having one baby — they were actually expecting quintuplets. 
“At first, I was scared,” Jessica said, according to the organization. “You hear it, you start panicking, asking, ‘Can my body do it?’ ”
The “amazing mother” is a 911 dispatcher, and when her colleagues learned about her high-risk pregnancy, they organized a GoFundMe to help the growing family. 
Dawei David Wang, MD, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at GCH Buffalo, informed the parents of the risks that Jessica faced while carrying quintuplets, according to the hospital.
“Pregnancies like this carry significantly increased risks, including preterm labor, hypertension, pre-eclampsia and diabetes,” he said. “There are also physical challenges from carrying five fetuses, including pressure on the cardiac and respiratory systems.”
Even as she navigated the possible complications, Jessica lived life as normally as possible as she awaited the arrival of her babies, including trick-or-treating with her girls and getting a Christmas tree, according to the hospital.
By Dec. 13, she was admitted to the Level IV NICU at GCH Buffalo, where teams had been preparing for the big day.
Jessica went into labor early, which her care team was able to stave off for a few days. Then her babies arrived.
“It was like a well-oiled machine,” Dr. Kavya Rao, a neonatologist at the hospital, told WKBW. “We had everyone that needed to be there from the second they were born, from the time they were stabilized, so each baby had about five team members.” 
In the early morning hours of Dec. 18, the five babies — Holly, Mason, Stefan, Connor and Layla — were born, each weighing about 2 lbs., according to the outlet.
Since the delivery, the babies have been growing in size, transitioning off oxygen and learning to bottle feed independently, according to the hospital. 
In an update on the donation page late last month, Jessica wrote that her son Mason had been sick with necrotizing enterocolitis, a potentially dangerous gastrointestinal problem, and had to be intubated  — but speaking with PEOPLE on Friday, Feb. 6, she says her son is on the mend.
""Mason is doing good,"" Jessica says. ""He has had some minor setbacks, and they needed to up his oxygen support, but overall, he is a fighter and gets a little bit stronger every day.""
His brother, Stefan, has had some setbacks as well, and has been preemptively treated for an infection as his medical team waits for lab work results. But his mom says that he appears to be making progress, and his brother, Connor, is doing well.
As for the girls, she says there's ""been talk of Holly and Layla coming home as early as next week, but nothing is guaranteed.""
""We are just taking everything one day at a time,"" she adds, sharing that when it comes to the boys, she imagines they still have several more weeks in the hospital to go.

As for other women navigating high-risk pregnancies, Jessica shared a bit of advice.
“Keep your head up,” she said, according to the hospital. “Remain strong, mama. It’s hard, but it’ll be worth it.”",mom-welcomes-quintuplets-following-high-risk-pregn,"The babies — three boys and two girls — were born late last year weighing about 2 lbs. each

A man's proposal took a turn as his nerves got the best of him.
Braydon Dewey, 22, proposed to Destiny Fajen, 22, last year on Aug. 24 at Halfmoon Town Park in Halfmoon, New York. Wanting it to be a ""perfect surprise,"" Dewey invited Fajen's family to witness the special moment. However, he was so ""nervous something would go wrong"" that his perfect plan fell apart as he puked in a nearby bush in front of everyone immediately after popping the question.
""I was worried and slightly confused about what had just happened,"" Fajen recalls to PEOPLE.
She continues, ""He actually whispered 'I'm sorry' right as he stood up to go throw up. I took a second to realize what was happening then went to go make sure he was okay.""
The bride-to-be shared a clip and several photos from the unexpected moment on TikTok on Feb. 5, writing, ""POV: Your fiancé was so nervous to propose to you that the second you said yes he went and threw up."" The post went viral, amassing about 14 million views and over 3 million likes in just 24 hours.
In the video, Dewey is all smiles when he asks Fajen to marry him while on bended knee. After he helps her slide on her diamond engagement ring, his eyes widen with panic and his cheeks puff out as a wave of nausea hits him. He quickly presses a hand over his mouth before running over to a bush and vomiting.
Fajen's closest relatives — including her parents, sister, aunt, uncle, and grandparents — watched on as she rushed over to comfort her fiancé by bending down, hugging him, and rubbing his back. Despite the mishap, she wasn't any less excited and maintained a beaming smile.
""Honestly, everyone kinda pretended it didn't happen, trying to make him feel better about it,"" she tells PEOPLE.
Although the public puking might have been a little embarrassing, Dewey didn't let it ruin the moment.

""To be honest, I was just relieved that it all went perfectly and she said 'yes,' "" he says.

Now, the mishap is just a funny memory.
""We have a photo of it framed in the house and get a good laugh out of it now,"" Fajen says.
Fajen recently commented on a photo of her soon-to-be husband under a TikTok video, and her comment went viral, inspiring her to make her TikTok post. She thinks it's ""amazing"" that it blew up so fast.
""The comments we are getting are hilarious,"" she adds.
One of the top comments jokes, ""You think he might be pregnant?""
""Oh he said in sickness starts NOW,"" another user wrote.
Someone else teased, ""Oh wedding day is gonna be a tough one for him😭.""
Fajen and Dewey met in 2022. At the time, Fajen was a hostess at a restaurant. Dewey came in as a customer, and ""the rest is history."" They made their relationship official on Feb. 23, 2022.

Cierra Moore didn't think she'd need to defend her daughter, who has a rare form of dwarfism, when they were trying to enjoy a basketball game together.
In a video shared to her TikTok, the Iowa-based mom of three shared her experience attending a basketball game, where she was questioned if her one-year-old daughter's wheelchair was actually a wheelchair and told she couldn't bring her medical supplies into the game.
Now Moore, whose daughter has rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata type 1 (RCDP), tells PEOPLE more about the situation and explains why she will always advocate for her daughter.
""My daughter Lakelynn was diagnosed at birth with RCDP, a rare and terminal form of dwarfism,"" she says. ""There is less than 100 affected children in the entire world. Typical life expectancy is 1-6 years.""

""It is characterized by intellectual disabilities, seizures, cataracts at birth, contractures [and] respiratory failure. And those are just a few of the many complications that come with this rare genetic disease,"" explains Moore. ""We have an in-home nurse that provides nursing care while I am at work.""
Moore says her daughter is G-tube dependent and eats every three hours. She gets physical therapy to stretch her muscles – Moore has to be very careful with her daughter's legs and arms, because moving them can cause severe pain.
""She has multiple doctor appointments a month, which I have to take time off work and drive almost two hours to her specialists,"" says the mom of three.
When she went to the basketball game earlier this month, Moore was surprised when she was immediately approached by a security officer who told her she couldn't bring her daughter's ""stroller"" into the venue.
""I explained that it was used as a wheelchair,"" says Moore. ""She then stated that carseat strollers were not allowed.""
Moore tried to explain her daughter's condition, but the security officer proceeded to tell her she also couldn't bring in her fanny pack, which she was using for her daughter's medical purposes.
""My mom explained to her why I need the fanny pack (it had urgent G-tube supplies in there) and I needed it in a ready accessible bag that was always attached to me,"" she says. ""If my daughter was to pull her G-tube out, I want to make sure I have her emergency tube that I can place in a quick manner so her hole does not close up. Then she told my mom that it needed to be in a clear bag.""
But the security officer still wouldn't listen to her. Moore and her mom decided it wasn't worth it and went to leave the venue. Moore took the elevator down with her daughter and was approached by another security officer, who again told her that her daughter's wheelchair wasn't allowed in the venue.
""I then told her that she was a dwarf and they don't just have wheelchairs in her size readily available,"" says Moore. ""I broke down in tears, and everyone waiting to get their tickets scanned witnessed this interaction. It really made me feel like my daughter didn't belong there. I truly feel like we were harassed by the staff and security personnel.""
Now, Moore says that her end goal is to make these establishments understand that parents who have kids with special needs require special equipment, such as wheelchairs and medical devices.
""We should not have to explain in detail why children need certain medical equipment, etc.,"" says Moore. ""No special needs parent should fear being rejected, and that is the point I'm going to make — raising awareness for special needs parents who need special accommodations and should never be questioned.""

Nine people — including two children — have been hospitalized in Idaho’s Ada County with complications of E. coli infections after drinking raw milk, health officials say.
Health officials said laboratory testing confirmed the presence of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli, or (STEC). It’s “one of the most potent bacterial toxins known,” the National Library of Medicine says.
The toxin can cause “cause severe foodborne illness, including bloody diarrhea and vomiting, and may lead to serious complications, particularly in children, older adults, and people with weakened immune systems,” Central District Health officials said in a press release announcing the outbreak.
“Two children are hospitalized with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS), a rare but serious complication of E. coli infection that can lead to kidney failure and long-term health problems. One case has laboratory-confirmed STEC infection; the second is epidemiologically linked based on reported consumption of the same brand of raw milk as other confirmed cases,” the officials say.
All of those sickened reported drinking raw milk from R Bar H, health officials say. PEOPLE has reached out to R Bar H for further information. Officials say the milk producer has pulled their products from shelves and suspended production while the investigation into the source of the contamination is underway.
It’s part of an ongoing uptick in illnesses linked to raw milk in Idaho. In November, the state reported that 26 people — including 6 children under the age of 12 —  had been sickened after drinking raw milk. Officials noted that “In Idaho, raw milk can be sold legally through multiple outlets, but it is not required to be tested for bacteria such as Campylobacter, E. coli or other disease-causing agents.”
The latest outbreak comes on the heels of news that a New Mexico newborn died of listeria, contracted after the infant’s mother drank raw milk while pregnant.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control advises people to drink milk that has been pasteurized — a process that “removes disease-causing germs by heating milk to a high enough temperature for a certain length of time.” 
“Pasteurized milk offers the same nutritional benefits without the risks of raw milk consumption,” the CDC says, adding that “good practices on farms can reduce contamination, they cannot guarantee safety from harmful germs.”",outbreak-from-drinking-raw-milk-leaves-9-hospitali,"Days after a New Mexico newborn's death was linked to the mother drinking raw milk while pregnant, health officials say 9 people were sickened in Idaho from non-pasteurized milk

Sabrina Carpenter has found true love, but there's a catch.
In a new Super Bowl 2026 ad for Pringles, the ""Espresso"" singer, fed up with real men, builds a boyfriend for herself, chip-by-chip. His name? Pringleleo.
The ad sees Carpenter and Pringleleo in a series of sweet vignettes. The pair go on a romantic date, ride with the top down, and spend time together in bed. But things go south when Pringleleo is tackled and destroyed by rabid fans, who eat the chips that once made up his body. In the end, the salty snacks are impossible to resist, and even Carpenter takes a bite of Pringleleo.
PEOPLE was the first to reveal that Carpenter would be appearing in her first-ever Super Bowl ad. In a trailer for the ad, Carpenter can be seen picking Pringles from a ""bouquet"" like flowers.
Carpenter may have manifested the collaboration years ago. In 2017, a 17-year-old Sabrina tweeted: ""Is there a way to look attractive while eating Pringles asking for a friend.""
The ad is part of Pringles' ongoing Once You Pop, The Pop Don't Stop campaign, which leans into the irresistibility of the classic potato chips that you can never have just one of.
Pringles is no stranger to featuring big stars in its Super Bowl ads. Last year, Pringles recruited Adam Brody, Nick Offerman, James Harden and Andy Reid for its Super Bowl 2025 commercial. The spot paid tribute to brand mascot Mr. P’s iconic handlebar mustache, as did its 2024 advertisement with Chris Pratt. Back in 2023, Pringles recruited another pop singer for its Super Bowl spot: Meghan Trainor.",sabrina-carpenter-builds-the-perfect-man-out-of-pr,"The pop star made her Super Bowl commercial debut in a hilarious new ad for Pringles.

A clinic in Dublin, Ireland, was ordered to pay $63,000 to a 41-year-old woman who claimed a laser treatment left her with damaged skin.
According to the Irish Times, 41-year-old graphic designer Hui Hao told Judge Roderick Maguire in the Circuit Civil Court on Wednesday. Jan. 28, that she had severe reactions to the elements since undergoing a laser treatment from Dundrum Cosmetic Clinic in Dublin.
“If I go out in bright or sunny days my face would now come out in red blotches all over,” she said in her €60,000 negligence claim against the clinic, per the Irish Times.
Hao told her lawyer, Deirdre Byrne, that from March to October, she has to use significant medical and cosmetic protection to go out and often has to stay inside on sunny days.
Hao claims that she visited the clinic in September 2021 to address mild pigmentation under her left eye. “From the moment the doctor applied the laser to my cheek I was in pain and I complained about it but he didn’t stop and continued until the end,” she told Judge Maguire, per the Irish Times.
Byrne told the court that since Hao had issued her legal proceedings in May 2023, the defendant clinic had ignored the claim and judgment had already been obtained against them for failure to enter an appearance to the claim.

Judge Maguire said that Hao had been offered two or three laser treatments but had only undergone one. She was told that pain after the treatment was normal and would resolve in a day. When it didn't, Hao returned and was given an unlabeled bottle of cream.
“Pigmentation had broken out around her face and close to her lips and the cream she was given had no effect,” the judge said.

He added, “She has been disfigured after having the treatment.""
Judge Maguire awarded Hao €46,496 ($63,053 USD) and costs.
One of Hao's lawyers, Stuart Gilhooly, tells PEOPLE that the company that owns Dundrum Cosmetic Clinic has ""never responded to any correspondence and were not represented in court.""

""It would be normal to hear from an insurance company,"" Gilhooly said via email. "" ... This is unacceptable from a large service provider and one that purports to provide a premium service for treatments that are of immense importance to women.""

Bachelor Nation fans can count on a fresh dose of drama to be served in HGTV's Bachelor Mansion Takeover!
PEOPLE can exclusively share the first trailer for the upcoming renovation competition series premiering Monday, March 2. The new show will follow 12 former Bachelor franchise contestants as they compete against each other to transform the iconic California home that fans know and love from the shows. 
In the above clip, host Jesse Palmer welcomes viewers to the “most dramatic renovation competition this mansion has ever seen.” As various interior shots of the property pan onto the screen, a voice in the background says, “Oh my god, if these walls could talk, they’d scream.”
Standing outside the home, Palmer announces: “For almost 20 years, this mansion has been the stage for roses and rejections. It’s where fairytales began, and where hearts were broken.”
After various old scenes from the franchise’s many seasons are shown, Palmer adds, “But now this legendary house is about to get a transformation of its own.”
A scene of the former contestants scoping out the familiar property then pans onto the screen as Golden Bachelorette alum Joan Vassos exclaims, “This looks so different!”
Palmer continues, “We brought together 12 Bachelor Nation alumni with real design and build expertise to give this place the makeover it deserves.” 
“They’ll build,” he says as shots of contestants getting their hands dirty while drilling and hammering are shown. 
“They’ll be judged,” he notes, as viewers catch a glimpse of some of the exciting guest judges, including HGTV stars Christina Haack and Nate Berkus, actress Rachel Bilson, and Bachelor alums JoJo Fletcher and Sean Lowe.
The series’ regular judges, Tayshia Adams and Tyler Cameron, also come down hard on each contestant, with Adams shaking her head in one scene and noting, “I don’t like it,” followed by Cameron adding, “I will say I don’t love the tile.”
“They’ll compete,” Palmer continues. “And in the end, only one will be crowned the winner, and walk away with a $100,000 cash prize.”
The trailer even reveals a few of the heated encounters viewers can expect to see, with Jill Chin yelling in one scene, “I hate your ideas and I always have!”
“I can’t let feelings get in the way of good design, ” adds Allyshia Gupta.
Palmer concludes dramatically, “The tools are real. The drama is real. And the stakes have never been higher.”

Throughout the six-episode season, the former contestants will compete to transform multiple spaces in the beloved mansion, including the bunk rooms, the rose room, the pool area, the mixer room, the terrace and the kitchen. Each week, design and renovation skills will be tested, and contestants will be eliminated after each project.

The 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China, begin on Feb. 3, which means that they coincide with Black History Month. Here, we're celebrating the accomplishments of the trailblazing, outstanding Black athletes who have made history at the Winter Olympics over the years.
In 1988, Thomas won the bronze medal in figure skating and became the first Black athlete to medal at the Winter Games — all while she was still a student at Stanford University. She remains the only African American woman to win a medal in figure skating.
Flowers, representing Team USA in the two-women blobsleigh, won gold at the 2002 Winter Olympics, which made her the first Black athlete to win Winter Olympics gold. Pictured, she gets emotional while accepting her medal alongside teammate Jill Bakken.
In 2002, Iginla, representing Team Canada, became the second Black athlete to win gold at the Winter Olympics, taking his home as part of Canada's ice hockey team.
In 2006, while competing at the Winter Olympics in Turin, U.S. speed skater Davis became the first Black athlete to win gold in an individual competition.
Meyers Taylor (right) became the first U.S. athlete, male or female, to medal as both a brakeman and driver in bobsled after winning bronze at the 2010 Winter Games and silver at the 2014 Winter Games. She also has a silver medal from the PyeongChang Games in 2018.
In 2022, the Olympian made history again, winning silver in the first ever women's monobob event.
Williams (right) was the first woman to win summer and winter Olympics medals. As a sprinter, she won gold in the 4x100m at the London 2012 Games and silver in the 100m at the Athens 2004 Games.
In 2014, she competed at the Sochi Olympics and won silver in the two-woman bobsled. Her teammate was none other than fellow trailblazer, Elana Meyers Taylor (left).
Jackson was the first Black woman to be on the U.S. long-track speed skating team, qualifying for the 2018 Winter Olympics after learning to speed skate just four months prior.
Jackson, who is the world's top-ranked woman in the 500m event for speed skating, came in 3rd place at the recent U.S. Olympic trials in Milwaukee, nearly missing the opportunity to go to Beijing. Her teammate, Brittany Bowe, gave up her qualifying spot to ensure Jackson could compete.
While competing at the 2022 Winter Olympics, Jackson made history yet again when she became the first Black woman to win a solo medal in speed skating after coming out victorious in the 500m event.
She is also the first U.S. woman to win gold in speed skating at the Olympics in nearly 30 years, after Bonnie Blair placed first in 1994.
Greenway was the first African American player to compete for the United States in Olympic ice hockey when he played at the 2018 Games in Pyeongchang.
In 2018, Adeagbo made history as a member of Nigeria's first Winter Olympics team, and became the first Nigerian and African woman to compete in skeleton.
In 2018, Frimpong was Ghana's second athlete to ever compete in the Winter Olympics and the first to represent Ghana in skeleton.
Simander made history in 2018 when she competed at the Winter Games for Team Kenya — she was the only athlete representing the country that year — and became the first from her country to compete in Alpine skiing.
Biney, originally from Ghana, became the youngest skater and first Black woman to make a U.S. Olympic short track speed skating team and the second-ever African-born athlete to represent the United States in the Winter Olympics in 2018.","12-outstanding,-history-making-black-winter-olympi","From being the first Black woman to earn a medal at the Winter Games to being the first to represent their countries, these exceptional Black athletes have made Winter Olympics history
