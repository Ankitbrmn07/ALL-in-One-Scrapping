The Olympic Village is all fun and games — until someone catches the highly contagious norovirus.
The notorious stomach virus has been slowly making its way through a few women’s hockey teams, prompting delays and postponements at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan.
On Feb. 5, the Games announced that the women’s Finland versus Canada ice hockey game would be postponed after Team Finland experienced a norovirus breakout.
“The decision was taken following consultations with medical professionals after cases of norovirus were identified within Team Finland,” the Games said in a press release. “It was made collectively and in accordance with established health and safety principles, with the health and wellbeing of players, team staff, officials and all tournament participants as the highest priority.”
The release acknowledged the “disappointment” of the postponement, but said it was a “responsible and necessary decision that reflects the spirit of the Olympic Games and the integrity of the competition.”
Thirteen members of Team Finland were either infected with the virus or in quarantine, the Associated Press reported. General manager Kimmo Oikarinen told the outlet on Feb. 6 that while the illnesses were “disappointing,” things were “getting better for the team.""
“Forfeit is the last thing we want to do. I don’t believe we will go there. I do not see that happening,” he said. “It is the Olympic Games, and we have been waiting for this for years. We all wanted to play, but there are things that happen. The main focus was to make sure our players will be healthy as soon as possible.”
Norovirus is a contagious virus that causes vomiting and diarrhea, per the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. While most people with the illness get better within one to three days, they can still spread the virus for a few days after.
Meanwhile, the Swiss Hockey Federation announced on Feb. 6 that one of its female hockey players had also tested positive for norovirus, shortly after Team Switzerland beat the Czech Republic in a hockey game.
The organization’s statement said the infected athlete had been housed in a single room since she arrived at the Olympic Village on Monday, Feb. 2, and was isolated from the team after she started exhibiting symptoms. 
Though the athlete was symptom-free as of Feb. 6, the team was isolated after the match, and the women’s Swiss national hockey team did not take part in the opening ceremony.
The Swiss Hockey Federation said on Saturday, Feb. 7 that the team will go ahead with their game against Canada as planned, because no one else has exhibited symptoms.
""The incubation period has now passed. Thanks to the immediate response and the prompt isolation of the affected player and the team, the potential chain of infection was broken early on,” said Hanspeter Betscharat, chief medical officer for the Swiss Olympic team. ""From a medical perspective, there are currently no concerns about the match taking place, provided no further players show symptoms.”",norovirus-is-ripping-through-hockey-teams-at-the-2,"Team Finland and Team Switzerland have had players affected by norovirus

Cardi B is an open book when it comes to the work she’s had done.
The “Bodak Yellow” rapper has undergone several elective surgeries since she shot to fame in 2017, and she’s never shied away from discussing her experiences under the knife with her fans.
Cardi has also been candid about the motivation behind her cosmetic work, which has more to do with her personal preferences than with self-esteem.
“People will be assuming that when you do surgery, you’re insecure about yourself or you hate yourself, and that’s just not the truth,” she explained during a November 2024 appearance on The Jason Lee podcast. “If I want to correct something or do a little something something, I’m going to do it.”
“I like being perfect,” she added. “I like a certain type of body for myself.”
From her breast augmentation to the procedures she’s regretted, here’s everything Cardi B has said about plastic surgery.
Long before she became famous, Cardi used money she earned working as a stripper to pay for a breast augmentation. During a 2021 conversation with Mariah Carey for Interview Magazine, the rapper shared that she had been insecure about her breasts since she was young.
“I was really skinny when I was younger, and in the Bronx, it’s about being thick and having an ass, so young boys would be like, ‘Look at your flat ass. You ain’t got no titties,' "" she recalled. ""And it would make me feel so ugly and undeveloped.""
She continued, “When I was 18 and became a dancer, I had enough money to afford to buy boobs, so every insecurity that I felt about my breasts was gone.”
Soon after getting her breasts done, Cardi moved on to her butt, and at age 21, she got biopolymer injections, silicone-based fillers that are not approved by the FDA and can cause life-threatening complications. The procedure cost the rapper $800 and was performed in a basement in Queens, N.Y.
“They don’t numb your ass with anything,” she told GQ in 2018 of the risky procedure. “It was the craziest pain ever. I felt like I was gonna pass out. I felt a little dizzy. And it leaks for, like, five days.”
Years later, in August 2022, Cardi had “95%” of her biopolymers removed. She opened up about the process during an Instagram Live that December and offered her fans some advice about plastic surgery.
“All I'm going to say is that if you're young, if you're 19, 20, 21, and sometimes you're too skinny, and you be like 'OMG I don't have enough fat to put in my ass,' so you result to ass shots, DON'T!” she said.
Cardi continued, “When it comes to BBLs, if y'all want advice from me, before you get your BBL done you have to make sure your blood levels are all right. If a doctor says your blood levels are too low or you have diabetes or whatever, don't do it.""
In January 2024, Cardi got another round of injections removed.
Shortly after her debut on Love & Hip Hop: New York, Cardi treated herself to a smile makeover with celebrity cosmetic dentist Dr. Catrise Austin. She had several porcelain veneers placed, and the experience was featured in the first episode of season 7 of the reality show.
“It was just something that people kept talking about … and I knew I was going to do more on TV,” she told a reporter at the season 7 premiere in November 2016. “I don't want my teeth distracting people from my talents or what I do.”
The rapper was so happy with her new smile that she included the line “Got a bag and fixed my teeth” in her breakout hit, “Bodak Yellow.”
During her appearance on The Jason Lee podcast, Cardi opened up about how she never liked her nose and always wanted it to be smaller.
""I always felt like I had a big nose,"" she explained. ""Even before I was famous, I was like 'Damn, I've got my daddy's nose.' ... I was always afraid to do my nose and I finally took that step.""
In 2019, she opted for nose fillers, as several people told her it was a better, non-surgical way to make her nose smaller. However, the fillers had the opposite effect.
“That s--- f---ed my nose up,” she said. “I was like, 'Oh my Gosh, what the f--- did I do to myself?' ""
“When you see stuff on Instagram, it makes sense. But fillers made my nose longer ... it got wider,"" she added.
Cardi then went through with a rhinoplasty in 2020.
While performing at the Beale Street Musical Festival in May 2019, Cardi revealed that she had recently undergone liposuction.
“I have some news for y’all. I should have canceled today,” she told her fans. “I shouldn’t really be performing because moving too much is gonna f--- up my lipo. But b---- I’m still gonna get my motherf---ing money back, let’s go!”
A few weeks later, Cardi had to postpone several scheduled performances after being given “strict doctor’s orders” to take it easy after her surgery, her rep told PEOPLE.
Cardi first floated the idea of liposuction in August 2018, one month after she welcomed her daughter, Kulture Kiari, whom she shares with ex-husband Offset.
“I still feel like I got a lot of love handles right here,” she said during an Instagram Live. “It’s not much but it’s like — I’m used to having, like, a real tight stomach.”
Years later, while appearing on Alex Cooper’s Call Her Daddy podcast in September 2025, the “WAP” rapper addressed a misconception that she is “always [on] the table” and explained that she didn’t get liposuction or any other procedure immediately after she gave birth.
“I take my time because I don’t want to die,” she explained. “You have to wait six, seven months before you get any type of surgery after you give birth because you lose so much blood. Your body is still contracting. Your organs are still contracting. Your breasts are getting smaller.”
In the same interview, Cardi opened up about whether she regrets any of the procedures she’s had.
“I look at myself in the mirror and it's like, I really wouldn’t change a thing,” she told Cooper. “Maybe I would like my butt to be smaller … but it’s, like I said, really hard for my butt to get smaller. I already did a reduction.”
She went on to describe how painful and lengthy the reduction process is, adding about her critics, “I’m not going to put myself in that position again because you don’t like my body.”
“I’m comfortable; I learned to live with it. I don’t get no complaints from nobody,” she concluded.
Cardi added that she feels she can't ""win"" the public, who she said will critique celebrities for hiding what procedures they've had done, but equally criticize her for being open.
“It really sucks so much,” she said. “When you do tell them your business, it’s bad too … you can never win.”",everything-cardi-b-has-said-about-her-plastic-surg,"Cardi B has always spoken candidly about her experiences under the knife

In a world of rumors run wild, there are all kinds of stories that take the internet by storm and provoke strong reactions — even from major public figures — before anybody even knows if the information is true. As one of the world's most-read digital publications, we take seriously our responsibility to fight against viral misinformation by having steadfast journalistic standards that guide us in telling true, accurate, and authoritative stories — always.
Every piece of content on PEOPLE is conceived of, created, and communicated to you with these core principles front of mind.
Bringing you the latest news is a big, never-ending production. Our reporters are among the most connected people in the world: on the red carpet, at the White House, in the worlds of tech, sports, style and beauty, food and more.
But we also shine at finding those small, never-before-heard stories of ordinary people doing extraordinary things—in any zip code in this country and beyond. Our news team members have their fingers on the pulse and keep you plugged in to what's happening, minute by minute, no matter the hour of day, and continuously as the story unfolds. And our expert editors are there to give you the best recommendations: what to watch, read, listen to, wear, cook and buy.
At PEOPLE, we hold some principles sacred. We will not publish a photograph of a celebrity's child taken against their parents' wishes, barring a serious news value. We believe in a person's right to privacy, so we will not expose a pregnancy or someone's health issues against their wishes, nor will we share identifying details that might betray the location of the home where a public figure resides. We always strive to have an open dialogue with the people we cover and give them an opportunity to tell their stories.

You may notice PEOPLE covers some pretty heavy topics, from themes of drug abuse and sexual assault to child abuse or suicide. At every turn, we're committed to helping you gain insight from these incredibly personal stories or be inspired to help: we will help you find a story subject's GoFundMe, if you're moved to make a donation, or we'll give you helpful resources if you or someone in your life is in a similar situation.
We have stringent guidelines for writing about suicide, and work in partnership with #CrisisTextLine to encourage people to make the call for help if they're struggling with their mental health. And we vet and will share links to legitimate 501c3 charities when we cover major developing news about everything from environmental crises to the war in Ukraine.

At its core, PEOPLE is a brand devoted to highlighting diverse stories: The triumphs, tragedies and extraordinary moments in the lives of all people. We have always been committed to representing as many voices as possible and work constantly to seek out and showcase new ones. We seek always to improve the diversity and scope of the talent we profile, stories we cover, people we feature, and platforms we amplify. It is a top priority for PEOPLE to be transparent about the steps we're taking to ensure our content is representative, fair, educational, and inclusive.
At PEOPLE, we strive to be a safe, inclusive, and judgment-free place to consume content.

PEOPLE is also guided by the People Inc. Anti-Bias Review Board, which advises on our content to ensure that it is free of bias and as inclusive as possible.

Our editorial teams do their best to update our large library of ""evergreen"" stories to ensure they continue to be timely, accurate, and relevant. Each article is date-stamped to reflect when they were last updated.

In the age of COVID and vaccine misinformation, no topic requires expert precision and more intense fact-checking than health coverage. To that end, our health team relies on the PEOPLE Health Squad, a team of doctors with specialties in many different areas we have at the ready, to explain and put into context everything from the latest recommendations on booster shots to that episode of And Just Like That that covered perimenopausal menstruation. We told you we take this stuff seriously.

Our writers and editors adhere to strict sourcing standards in all our articles. All facts and claims are backed up by at least one reputable source, and we aim to be transparent as to the origin of information in any developing situation.
In our crime coverage, or in the case of a major disaster, where first responders and law enforcement respond to the scene, we rely on the district's Public Information Officer, interviews directly with members of law enforcement and court documents for the facts of the case. We always make every effort to reach out to legal representation for all defendants, or any individuals that are profiled in our coverage.

There’s very little Cardi B hasn’t shared about herself, whether it’s anecdotes from her former career as a stripper or insight on how she’s grappling with the pressures of instant fame. But her latest revelation might be her most personal yet.
In a new interview with GQ, the rapper, who confirmed rumors of her pregnancy during an SNL performance over the weekend, revealed that four years ago she had shady butt injection plastic surgery done in a basement in Queens.
The star said she received an underground, $800 butt-enhancing treatment at the age of 21 because she wanted to make more money as a stripper. But because she “didn’t have enough meat” on her body, she couldn’t go for liposuction to transfer fat to her backside. So instead, she had a woman inject fillers into the area.
“They don’t numb your ass with anything,” she told GQ of the dangerous plastic surgery procedure. “It was the craziest pain ever. I felt like I was gonna pass out. I felt a little dizzy. And it leaks for, like, five days.”

It seems that Cardi was one of the lucky ones, because when she went back for a second round of injections, the woman who administered them was allegedly in jail.

Cardi B is giving an update on her experience with plastic surgery.
The ""Up"" rapper, 30, recently appeared on Instagram Live and warned her followers about doing their research before getting cosmetic procedures done. She explained that she wanted to be open with her fans because ""a lot of people thought as soon as I gave birth [to son Wave, 15 months] I got my body done.""
""In August I got surgery and I removed 95% of my biopolymers... if you don't know what it is, it's ass shots. It was a really crazy process,"" Cardi B — who previously discussed getting the illegal silicone shots for $800 in a basement in 2014 — explained. ""All I'm going to say is that if you're young, if you're 19, 20, 21, and sometimes you're too skinny, and you be like 'OMG I don't have enough fat to put in my ass,' so you result to ass shots, DON'T!""
""When it comes to BBLs, if y'all want advice from me, before you get your BBL done you have to make sure your blood levels are all right,"" she added. ""If a doctor says your blood levels are too low or you have diabetes or whatever, don't do it.""
Cardi B, who also confirmed her recent rhinoplasty, has never shied away from discussing her plastic surgery experiences. Back in 2021, she said the enhancements make her feel confident.
""Well, I'm from New York, right? And New York is a melting pot, especially where I grew up in the Bronx. I was really skinny when I was younger, and in the Bronx, it's about being thick and having an ass so young boys would be like, 'Look at your flat ass. You ain't got no titties.' And it would make me feel so ugly and undeveloped,"" the rapper said in an intimate conversation with Mariah Carey for her Interview cover story.
When Cardi was old enough to work as a dancer in a strip club, she used her earnings to get breast implants, which was the first step toward forgetting about her insecurities.
""When I was 18 and became a dancer, I had enough money to afford to buy boobs, so every insecurity that I felt about my breasts was gone,"" she said at the time. But by age 20, enhancing her butt became her next priority. ""When I was 20, I went to the urban strip club, and in the urban strip clubs, you had to have a big butt. So I felt insecure about that. It took me back to high school. So I got my ass done.""
In addition to her previous augmentations, the rapper underwent a second breast surgery as well as liposuction in 2019 following the birth of daughter Kulture, now 4.",cardi-b-shares-advice-for-anyone-considering-plast,"The rapper warned her fans to do research and listen to doctors before getting any cosmetic procedures

In 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration issued a safety communication warning consumers that ""injectable silicone used for body contouring is not FDA-approved and can cause serious side effects that may be permanent or may even lead to death.""
""Side effects can include ongoing pain and serious injuries, such as scarring, tissue death, and permanent disfigurement; if the silicone migrates beyond the injection site, it could cause an embolism (blockage of a blood vessel), stroke, infections and death. Serious complications may occur right away or could develop weeks, months, or years later,"" added the federal agency.
Later in the Instagram Live, Cardi also shared how she ""automatically"" knew she was pregnant again when she ""woke up one morning and my mouth tasted like copper.""

Cardi B has never shied away from discussing her plastic surgery experiences, and now the rapper is detailing her unwanted nose job after receiving botched fillers.
The 30-year-old appeared on a new episode of REVOLT's The Jason Lee Show where she opened up her past cosmetic procedures and how Kim Kardashian gave her surgeon recommendations for a nose job.
""I always felt like I had a big nose,"" Cardi told host Jason Lee. ""Even before I was famous, I was like 'Damn, I've got my daddy's nose.' I was always afraid to do my nose but I finally took that step.""
The ""WAP"" rapper recalled being told by several people back in 2018 that nose fillers were a better and non-surgical way to make her nose smaller, so she went through with it.
""I did fillers on my nose in 2019. And that s— f—--- my nose up,"" she said before admitting that she didn't even know how the fillers were supposed to work. ""I was like, 'Oh my God, what did I do to myself?'""
Cardi said it's important for her to share her horror story for those who are considering similar procedures.
""When you see stuff on Instagram, it just makes sense. But fillers just made my nose longer and it got wider,"" Cardi explained, adding that because of the botched procedure she had ""no choice"" but to get surgery on her nose.
Lee then asked the Grammy winner how she decides which doctors perform her surgeries, recalling a moment when Kardashian, 42, gave her some advice.
""I remember the time we were at Kris' [Jenner] house and Kim gave you a list of people you could call to get help,"" he said. ""You didn't call none of those people?""
""No, I called a couple of people that she gave me,"" Cardi responded, noting that she ultimately went with someone else and got her rhinoplasty in 2020.
Now, Cardi said she's done with plastic surgery, boasting, ""I look great."" During the podcast, she also assured that there's nothing wrong with her decision to get any cosmetic procedures.
""This is the tricky thing about a lot of people. People will assume when you do surgery or something, you're insecure about yourself or you hate yourself, and that's just not the truth,"" Cardi said. ""If I want to correct something, if I want to do a little something-something like … I'm gonna do it. I like being perfect.

Cardi B is owning up to getting liposuction.
After denying it for months, the 26-year-old rapper told the crowd at the Beale Street Music Festival in Memphis on Sunday night that she did get the plastic surgery.
A few songs into her set, Cardi B, dressed in a skin-tight, sparkly red jumpsuit, said that she shouldn’t really be on stage.
“I have some news for y’all. I should have canceled today,” she said at the festival, sponsored by Facebook. “I shouldn’t really be performing because moving too much is gonna f— up my lipo. But bitch I’m still gonna get my motherf—ing money back, let’s go!”
The crowd erupted into laughs and cheers after her announcement.
Back in August, one month after giving birth to her first child, daughter Kulture Kiari, Cardi B floated the idea of getting liposuction.
“I still feel like I got a lot of love handles right here,” she said, while pulling on her tummy. “It’s not much but it’s like — I’m used to having, like, a real tight stomach … I might just get a little lipo, you know what I’m sayin’?”

Two months later, in October, the “I Like It” singer showed off her toned stomach on her Instagram story, but said it was all natural.
“I never did lipo, bro. Never,” she told the camera.
However, last Wednesday she revealed that she had a second breast augmentation.
“I just got my boobs redone,” she said. “I feel good, but then sometimes I feel like not, you know? [When] your skin is stretched out. Yes, my daughter f—ed me up. She did. She so did.”
A day later, Cardi B wowed fans with her rock-hard abs at the Billboard Music Awards. Decked out in an ab-baring, two-piece yellow outfit, she went on to win six awards.

Sarah Michaud is the senior news editor of PEOPLE's music vertical. She has been working at PEOPLE for 18 years.
Cardi B has postponed several upcoming concerts after being given “strict doctor’s orders” to take it easy following her recent plastic surgery procedures.
A rep for the 26-year-old rapper tells PEOPLE, “Cardi was overzealous in getting back to work; she didn’t take the time necessary to fully recover from her surgery.”
“Her strenuous schedule has taken a toll on her body and she has been given strict doctor’s orders to pull out of the rest of her performances in May,” the rep adds.
On Monday, many fans expressed concern on Twitter after reports surfaced that Cardi had backed out of a Memorial Day Weekend concert in Maryland. The Grammy Award-winning rapper was set to headline the 92Q Spring Bling Festival Friday night.
The radio station later confirmed the news, explaining the show would be postponed to a later date as a result of health issues.
Cardi was also scheduled to perform Tuesday night at El Paso County Coliseum in Texas.
“She’s very disappointed as she hates to let her fans down,” Cardi’s rep says. “She reassures them that she will see them in September.”
After denying having had the procedure last fall, Cardi admitted at the Beale Street Musical Festival in Memphis on May 5 that she had recently undergone liposuction.
A few songs into her set, Cardi, dressed in a skin-tight, sparkly red jumpsuit, said that she shouldn’t be on stage.
“I have some news for y’all. I should have canceled today,” she said at the festival, sponsored by Facebook. “I shouldn’t really be performing because moving too much is gonna f— up my lipo. But bitch, I’m still gonna get my motherf—ing money back, let’s go!”
Cardi later said she changed her mind because she wanted to tell the truth.
“It was important for me because I don’t like lying about things,” she told E! News on May 8 during a performance for her new Fashion Nova collection.
Cardi said she also wants people to understand that liposuction results don’t happen immediately.
“Like when you see somebody that had lipo, you think that they just go into the doctor’s and like boop, you come out and you look amazing, and it’s actually like a very long process, recovery,” she said. “It actually takes like a little bit more than three or four months.”
“The stages are very frustrating,” she said. “Sometimes it gets a little bit discouraging. You have to get your massages all the time. And sometimes, it might not come out like you wanted it to be. But right now, I’m actually enjoying it.”
One issue she does have, though, is when people doubt that her ab muscles are real.
“What I don’t like is people who are like, ‘She did ab sketching.’ And it’s like, no no no,” she said. “I always had abs, and I’m a very skinny person so when they’re taking extra fat out and your skin is tightening more, like my bones actually show more.”
Back in August, one month after giving birth to her first child, daughter Kulture Kiari with husband Offset, Cardi floated the idea of getting liposuction.
“I still feel like I got a lot of love handles right here,” she said, while pulling on her tummy. “It’s not much, but it’s like — I’m used to having, like, a real tight stomach … I might just get a little lipo, you know what I’m sayin’?”
Two months later, in October, the “I Like It” rapper showed off her toned stomach on her Instagram Stories, but said it was all natural.
“I never did lipo, bro. Never,” she told the camera.
On May 1, she revealed that she had recently had a second breast augmentation.
“I just got my boobs redone,” she said. “I feel good, but then sometimes I feel like not, you know? [When] your skin is stretched out. Yes, my daughter f—ed me up. She did. She so did.”
A day later, Cardi wowed fans with her rock-hard abs at the Billboard Music Awards. Decked out in an ab-baring, two-piece yellow outfit, she went on to win six awards.",cardi-b-postpones-several-concerts-to-fully-recove,"""Cardi was overzealous in getting back to work, she didn't take the time necessary to full recover from her surgery,"" her rep tells PEOPLE

Adjusting to your new body after having a baby can be challenging, and new mom Cardi B is speaking out about this struggle — and considering taking matters into her own hands.
The 25-year-old rapper welcomed her first child, a baby girl named Kulture Kiari, with husband Offset on July 10. And just seven weeks later, she said in an Instagram Live video that she’s considering liposuction to remove some of the extra pounds and loose skin around her stomach.
“I still feel like I got a lot of love handles right here,” she said to the camera on Thursday as she pulled on her tummy. “It’s not much but it’s like — I’m used to having, like, a real tight stomach.”
The Bodak Yellow hitmaker also shared that she doesn’t have time to work out — “If I’m not working, I gotta make sure my baby’s okay,” she said — so she’s exploring a surgical option. “I might just get a little lipo, you know what I’m sayin’?” she told fans.

But is liposuction a good idea only seven weeks after giving birth?
According to Mary Jane Minkin, MD, a practicing gynecologist and professor at Yale School of Medicine, the answer is no — largely because it just wouldn’t be effective. “Of course I would never encourage this!” she tells PEOPLE.
During pregnancy, a woman’s body gains weight “diffusely” so it’s all over the body, Dr. Minkin says, whereas liposuction targets weight in one specific part and it’s impractical to do it everywhere. What’s more, the stretched skin lots of moms have after pregnancy will not “disappear” with liposuction.

“You can suck out some fat cells, but the skin will still be looser,” she explains. “And liposuction won’t tighten your muscles. Exercise will.”
She adds, “A fabulous way to lose weight after a baby is breastfeeding. You will feed the baby 500 calories or so a day initially. Then, as the baby grows, you will be feeding her up to 1,000 calories a day.”
Cardi B and Offset, 26, seem in awe of their baby girl. Just last week, the Grammy-nominated artist shared a sweet photo of herself and the Migos member looking down sweetly at their little one.
Although most of the baby’s face was cropped out, the proud mom did show the top of Kulture’s head and a tiny white bonnet. “KultureK,” she captioned the Instagram post.
Since giving birth in July, Cardi B has managed to keep Kulture out of the spotlight. However, she has shared a few glimpses with her fans.
On Friday, she posted a video of the back of Kulture’s head with a hand gently touching her, writing on her Instagram Story, “I love my grandpa.”
Earlier this month, the new mom posted an Instagram Story of her baby girl’s cute feet. “I got home at 8:30 a.m. from my flight she been up this whole time! I fed her twice and bath[e] her she ain’t with it,” Cardi B wrote over the black-and’white photo.",new-mom-cardi-b-wants-liposuction-to-get-rid-of-he,"Cardi B shared on Instagram that she's not happy with the ""love handles"" on her post-baby body and wants liposuction

Cardi B also shared a sneak peek of her daughter's birthday festivities via Instagram Stories.
In one of the clips, the 7-year-old can be seen enjoying some time with her friends while doing the whip and nae nae dance. The next video showed the birthday girl opening up some of her presents on a private jet.
The famed rapper is a father to six children. He shares three children with fellow rapper Cardi B: their daughter Blossom, 10 months, son Wave Set, 3, and Kulture. He also is a father to sons Kody, 10, and Jordan, 15, and daughter Kalea Marie, 9, from previous relationships.
When he spoke with PEOPLE in honor of his new collaboration with Doritos in September 2022, the ""Ric Flair Drip"" rapper opened up about balancing his career with being a father.
""Being a father's important to me personally,"" Offset said. ""For instance, there's a big party on Saturday, right? In Los Angeles. And my son Kody's first football game is on Sunday. There's no way I'm missing either event, so I'm going to have to make it work. It's priority to me.""

In a 2019 cover story for Haute Living, the ""Swing My Way"" rapper opened up about how much he’s learned about being a parent since he welcomed his first child when he was 17.
“The journey of fatherhood was kind of tough for me at first,” Offset told the outlet. “I was trying to find myself. I didn’t have much direction on what it meant to be a father.”
“I definitely made some mistakes, but I have no regrets,” he continued, adding that things were especially difficult when his children were younger and he had to spend time away from them while performing across the country.
“It’s challenging when you have a career like this and you’re constantly on the road. It makes it tough to see your kids, especially when they’re young,” Offset explained. “Now that I’m older, though, I’m learning my way.”",cardi-b-shares-scenes-from-kultures-7th-birthday-c,"The rappers welcomed their daughter in July 2018

Alex Cooper is the name behind one of the most successful podcasts to date: Call Her Daddy.
Self-titled the ""Founding Father,"" Cooper has taken the podcast in a direction that's evolved tremendously since its release in 2018. Originally synonymous with its sex-heavy topics in what was branded ""female locker-room talk,"" her podcast now puts ""a modern twist on feminism"" in each episode that airs, according to marketing materials.
While Call Her Daddy covers a wide range of topics in typical podcast fashion, Cooper has become known for her tell-all interviews with Hollywood's A-listers. Guests have included Miley Cyrus, Chelsea Handler, John Mayer, Kelsea Ballerini and fake German heiress Anna Delvey.
In June 2021, Cooper and Spotify made a three-year deal worth more than $60 million in total, per Variety, which makes it the streaming platform's biggest exclusive deal for a female-led podcast ever. ""I want to be the biggest podcast in the world,"" Cooper revealed to the Wall Street Journal.
With an annual salary of $20 million, Cooper is now the highest-paid female podcaster on Spotify — and second only to Joe Rogan overall, the Los Angeles Times reported in June 2022. ""A woman just got what in the past would've been a male contract,"" she told the outlet.
As for her personal life, Cooper married Hollywood producer Matt Kaplan in April 2024.
Here's everything to know about Cooper, from her days as a Division I college athlete to her globally recognized career.
Prior to Cooper's three-year Spotify deal in 2021, Barstool Sports acquired Call Her Daddy approximately one month after its first episode aired in 2018.
Since the podcast's debut, the show's structure has evolved tremendously. Among one of the major changes? Cooper now hosts solo, a duty that came after parting ways with Sofia Franklyn — her former co-host, best friend and business partner — in April 2020.
The podcast went dark that year, leading tabloids and fans — deemed the ""Daddy Gang"" — to speculate about a fallout between Cooper and Franklyn, especially since the two posted that they ""legally can't speak out"" on the behind-the-scenes talk at the time.
Details remain murky as to what exactly caused the partnership to ""go up in flames,"" as Time put it, but it was in part due to a contract renegotiation with Barstool Sports. Ultimately, Cooper picked Call Her Daddy back up, while Franklyn started her own show a few months later.
For years, Call Her Daddy was synonymous with sex. It was known for raunchy talk and coining concepts like the ""Gluck Gluck 9000"" (an oral sex technique, FYI), keeping with the program's original ""female locker-room talk"" ethos.
Today, Cooper still exudes big-sister energy with the sex advice she distributes, but her content has evolved and expanded — despite people telling her ""they miss the old Call Her Daddy,"" she told the Los Angeles Times. Now, she covers a wider range of topics and caters to a broader demographic.
""It was like, 'How many times can we talk about sex?'"" she told the Los Angeles Times. ""I was getting a little bit bored. I need to be mentally stimulated by my content.""
Since then, topics on the show have included ""reclaiming your power"" after experiencing trauma, sexual fluidity, self-love and debunking mental health stigmas. Most of all, she wants to expand her conversations into the realm of female empowerment.
Furthermore, Call Her Daddy has taken on an interview-heavy format, featuring conversations between Cooper and some of the biggest names in Hollywood. The Q&A style is intimate, and Cooper gets stars to be candid about headline-making topics.
For example, when Jamie Lynn Spears was a guest on the show, she hoped to put to rest the accusations that she didn't help her sister Britney throughout her conservatorship. Hailey Baldwin Bieber revealed her favorite sex position with husband Justin Bieber, while Jane Fonda opened up about the ""secret life"" she used to live while struggling with an eating disorder.
On April 6, 2024, Cooper and Kaplan wed in Riviera Maya, Mexico.
“It was everything we wanted it to be,” the podcast host told Vogue. “It was emotional, heartfelt, and we tailored it to exactly how we always envisioned it.”
Cooper walked down the aisle in a custom gown by designer Danielle Frankel, while Kaplan donned a custom suit by The Cloakroom.
The Hollywood producer proposed to Cooper in March 2023 at their home in Los Angeles.
""I like, blacked out,"" Cooper recalled of the moment her now-husband got down on one knee. ""I think I said, 'yes,' at first. It was very surreal.""
Their engagement came after three years of dating, during most of which Cooper kept Kaplan's identity a secret from her fans. When mentioning him on her podcast, she would refer to him as only ""Mr. Sexy Zoom Man"" until revealing his identity in April 2023.
Although Cooper's fanbase has primarily consisted of millennials and Gen-Z over the years, there are two people who have been loyal followers since day one: her parents.
""They have always been my number one supporters,"" Cooper told Today. ""Even when people in my extended family would be like, 'Has she lost her mind?', my parents were like, 'No, because we know Alex and we know how we raised her and we know her talent.'""
Cooper's mom Laurie, a psychologist, has appeared on Call Her Daddy several times in the past. But while Cooper has created a name for herself as a go-to for advice, she's also gained some guidance from the person who knows her best.
""If she's talking to me about relationships, it's like, 'Do not lose yourself just to be with someone. Stay true to who you are,'"" Cooper told E! News. ""I think that goes through to every other aspect whether that's job, friendship, life, career.""
If there's something Cooper wants to make clear, it's that her success wasn't something that she just ""fell into."" Having attended Boston University as a Division I soccer player while majoring in film and television, the Call Her Daddy host worked hard to land where she is now.
Cooper's publicist considers her a ""one-woman operation,"" the Los Angeles Times reported. In addition to recording her own podcasts, she researches and edits almost entirely herself. According to Time, Spotify claims she's the most ""hands-on"" podcasting talent on its roster.
""There's this assumption that making a podcast is easy, but it's a lot of f—ing work. I take it with great pride that my whole life revolves around it,"" she told the Los Angeles Times. ""Every Sunday I'm working, I work seven days a week. And I love it. I would not want to do anything else.""","all-about-alex-cooper,-host-of-the-call-her-daddy-","Here's everything to know about Alex Cooper, the podcast host who's famously interviewed stars including Miley Cyrus, Jane Fonda and Hailey Bieber
