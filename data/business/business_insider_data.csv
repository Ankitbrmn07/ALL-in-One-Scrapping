Based on my limited experience there, it seemed like any other global city.
However, when I moved there for work in 2019, I quickly fell in love with the city's architecture, diversity, and beauty. Here are my tips for exploring the city like a local.
When planning a trip to Milan, it might seem logical to stay near the Duomo, as many of the major sights are concentrated there. For a more local experience, though, I recommend staying outside the tourist epicenter.
For example, the Porta Romana neighborhood is known for its hip bars and restaurants, and is home to the Fondazione Prada contemporary art center. For visitors who want to take in Art Nouveau architecture, museums, and gardens, I suggest checking out Porta Venezia.
Luckily, because of Milan's extensive metro and tram system, you can stay in any of these nearby neighborhoods and still be at the major tourist sites within minutes.

One of the best things about Milan is the diverse dining scene. No matter what you're craving, you'll find it here.
Traditional Milanese dishes are typically meat- and dairy-focused and feature ingredients like risotto, mondeghili (meatballs), and costoletta alla Milanese (veal cutlet). In my opinion, it would be a shame to visit Milan without trying at least one hearty, warm, porridge-like risotto (especially if you're visiting in the winter).
However, if you have time for a few meals in the city, follow a local's lead and head to one of the many spots that go beyond Italian cuisine, from fine-dining fusion to street food.
I especially love visiting Gastronomia Yamamoto, a Japanese homestyle restaurant near the Duomo, and Cittamani, a contemporary Indian restaurant in the Brera neighborhood. Chinatown is also a great spot to visit for good street food.
If you're planning on dining at a sit-down restaurant, however, I always recommend making a reservation in advance.
After living in Milan for seven years, I've found that although it may seem to be a city of modern apartment buildings and skyscrapers, it's also home to a network of historic houses that have been converted into museums, known as Case Museo di Milano.
My favorite is Villa Necchi Campiglio — the grand former estate of sewing-machine-empire heiresses Nedda and Gigina Necchi.
Relaxing in the villa's garden, exploring its ornate sitting rooms, and climbing the elegant staircase are great ways to get a peek into the sisters' luxurious lifestyles.
I also recommend visiting the nearby Casa Museo Boschi di Stefano, a free museum that houses a personal 20th-century art collection owned by the city of Milan.
The small home is packed with inventive, colorful furniture, Murano glass chandeliers, and sometimes, contemporary art exhibits.
In terms of art, one of Milan's best-known masterpieces is Leonardo da Vinci's ""Last Supper"" (""Il Cenacolo""). Although it's absolutely worth seeing, tickets to view the piece typically need to be booked in advance.
However, locals know that da Vinci's other works can be seen with a little less planning.
For example, at the Pinacoteca Ambrosiana, visitors can browse the ""Codex Atlanticus"" — the largest collection of Da Vinci's original drawings and text — in digital form, and see a selection of the original pages on display. The museum is also home to Da Vinci's ""Portrait of a Musician.""",im-an-american-whos-lived-in-milan-for-7-years.-he,"When I first moved from the US to Italy in 2017, Milan wasn't on my radar for a potential home.

When the community college where I taught offered free memberships at a new gym, I quickly signed up. I expected exercise, but I got so much more.
Over 30 years later, I'm 81, and still going to the gym every other day. It's still an important part of my health routine.
The weight room is full of young people lifting weights, and they pound their feet on treadmills like the start of the Kentucky Derby.
But the gym is also filled with older people. There's the 87-year-old woman who runs up and down the stairs ""because it feels good,"" while her 91-year-old husband maintains a steady pace on the treadmill.

As a swimmer, I've met several people around my age, welcoming each other into the pool.
With a somewhat older crowd, I am pleasantly surprised at how disabilities and imperfections are of no consequence in the pool. Surgery scars, including mastectomies and even amputations, are not worthy of the slightest stare or question. The miracle of being in the water is that handicaps and age disappear.
Even those who enter the pool in a lift achieve equality once they are buoyant. I've witnessed physical challenges that make me realize how insignificant my own are.
When I first came to the gym to exercise, I didn't expect to make friends — acquaintances, yes, but not friendships that mattered.
But then I met Maria, an 80-year-old Austrian with an infectious laugh. I heard her in the locker room as she shared a recipe for Wiener Schnitzel with someone. I had seen her in the pool, swimming with her head held high to keep her beautifully coiffed hair dry. I smiled and said goodbye as I left. The next day, I swam alongside her. I switched to a slow breaststroke so I could keep my head out and hear her story — and what a story it was.
A well-to-do Austrian, married to a doctor, she, her husband, and three children were reduced to refugee status under the Russian occupation at the end of World War II. In 1957, they were able to emigrate to the US. Because of their belief in the American Dream, they thrived. Maria often commented on their good fortune; she also taught me European history. She taught me a little German and showed me that laughter is the best antidote for any problem.
Soon, our casual acquaintance became a dear friendship that lasted until her death at 103 in 2022. We spent over 20 years together at the gym, four days a week. I made other friends as well. All of us loved and admired Maria.
Going to the gym multiple times a week has kept me more than young; it's kept me moving into my 80s.
I have fairly severe scoliosis, and it hurts. Without swimming and core strengthening at the gym, I don't want to think about how much worse it would be.
Over the years, I've learned that going to the gym is the best thing I can do for myself.
I am stronger than yesterday — stronger in my body, stronger in friendships, and stronger in optimism.","im-81-years-old,-and-i-still-love-going-to-the-gym","When our family moved to Oregon from Southern California in 1974 for my husband's new job, I fell in love with the Pacific Northwest.
