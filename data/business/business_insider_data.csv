Super Bowl LX comes to San Francisco this weekend, and that means scores of wealthy football fans arriving by private jet.
For Andrew Collins, CEO of private jet provider Flexjet, it's one of the busiest times of year and comes with its own set of challenges.
It ""is really time-sensitive because you don't know who's going to be in the Super Bowl until almost the last minute,"" Collins told Business Insider in an interview.
The deciding conference championships happen two weeks before the big event. Sunday's Super Bowl will see the New England Patriots take on the Seattle Seahawks at Levi's Stadium in the Bay Area.
Collins himself, a Patriots fan, said his son is ""a little bummed out"" because they were close to going, but ""then my schedule sort of precluded it.""

Flexjet offers fractional ownership, allowing customers to buy a share of an aircraft based on how often they want to fly it.
The Super Bowl is one of just a handful of days when customers need to give longer notice to fly, which Flexjet calls ""published peak days,"" Collins said. Instead of a typical 10-hour notification, it would be as long as 72 hours.
Flexjet reports that its flight requests are pacing ahead of last year's Super Bowl in New Orleans. It's also operating nearly 30% more flights into the Bay Area compared to the same week last year
San Jose Mineta International Airport, a five-mile drive from Levi's Stadium, said it expects more than 230 additional commercial flights this week.
But private fliers use fixed-base operators: dedicated private terminals, often luxurious, that also provide other services such as refuelling.
Compared to the commercial side of airports, they also tend to be ""much more fluid and dynamic"" during big events, Collins said. ""So they will charge special amenities and things like that, that can get very high.""
At San Jose Mineta International, FBOs are charging special-event fees ranging from $3,675 for a single-prop plane to $28,810 for a Gulfstream G650.
""It has been a fact of life for the past few years, especially,"" Collins added, of the event fees. He put this down to two things: the rising popularity of private aviation, and the acquisition of more FBOs by private equity firms.
Flexjet is also adding a pop-up private terminal at Oakland Airport with its own lounge.
Flying private might help well-heeled sports fans avoid the crowds in airport terminals, but, just like roads during a big event, the sky also gets congested.
Due to the expected high traffic, the Federal Aviation Administration has implemented special procedures at 17 Bay Area airports to enhance safety and minimize delays. These include extended air traffic control operating hours and restrictions on the number of flights.
For private-jet operators like Flexjet, ensuring flights run smoothly often comes down to who you know.
""In order to do large events like that, you have to have a very robust set of relationships,"" said Collins. ""We have significant formal and informal relationships across airports and across fixed-based operators.""
As the firm plans its schedules and customers book flights, these contacts can help point them in the right direction.
""They might shift you in terms of, you might want to think about having somebody come in at this point versus this point because the traffic flow is going to be easier,"" Collins said.
Planning flights already involves several variables, but big events add more factors to consider: From the surrounding infrastructure to special event fees and slot programs. Flexjet's operations team spends months planning for big events, and works around the clock from its control center in Cleveland.
""It can be the Super Bowl, it can be an F1 race. It can be that slots are really in demand and limited parking. It could be weather,"" Collins told Business Insider.
""There are a lot of things, but you have to be ready for that,"" he added. ""You have to be planning in as many ways as possible and as proactively as you can.""",the-ceo-of-private-jet-firm-flexjet-explains-how-i,"Every time Pete publishes a story, you’ll get an alert straight to your inbox!

Jonathan Prieur's career in markets began just as his flying career seemed to abruptly end. The 49-year-old pilot had a contract to switch to a new airline in 2020, which was canceled when the pandemic brought air travel to a halt. Stressed out, he turned to something he had put on the back burner for years, but had always hoped would boost his income: trading.
For Prieur, who now flies for Qatar Airways and has a stable income, the crisis has blown over — but he's still day trading. In between trips and after long flying shifts, he takes off his pilot hat and jumps headfirst into markets, executing short-term forex trades with profits that range from the low single digits to more than 10% on a month, according to his own account and recent brokerage statements he showed Business Insider.
The side gig won't turn him into a millionaire, but it's the principle of trading on the side that matters, Prieur said, adding that he hopes to one day achieve financial freedom for his own peace of mind.
""Yes, the trading is stressful, yes the mortgage and whatnot. But I know that if at least I'm working on my trading, I am trying to find a solution,"" Prieur said. ""It's not far away.""
Pilots have long been avid investors, but those in the profession say that the yearning for financial freedom has sharpened in recent years, ever since the pandemic upended air travel and pushed many to search for alternative sources of income.

That, paired with six-figure salaries and a lot of free time — two perks that have always come attached to the pilot role — was the perfect recipe for the surge of pilots who have turned to markets in recent years. Trading for them is either in pursuit of financial freedom, or simply to fill long stretches of downtime, according to pilots and others in the aviation business who spoke with Business Insider.
The percentage of pilots who have developed a side hustle unrelated to aviation rose four percentage points over the last two decades, according to data from the workforce intelligence firm Revelio Labs.
The proportion of pilots with a finance-related side-hustle, while small, has nearly doubled over that timeframe. Sharp increases were seen in the years after the Great Financial Crisis and in 2020, two periods when pilots faced elevated unemployment.
Chatter about markets has always made its way into the cockpit, but pilots have become more active investors in recent years alongside the broader retail-trading boom, according to Alex Tapia, a wealth planner who works with aviation professionals. Over the last five years, he estimates his firm, Pilot Money, has seen a 50% increase in clients who are short-term investors and are active in markets.
Pilots tend to be private, Prieur said. He himself keeps his own trading under wraps, out of fear of drawing jealousy or ""bad energy."" But, should a fellow pilot talk markets, it's often met with a flood of enthusiasm.
A few things explain why it's become a popular pursuit.
For one, many pilots are sitting on a healthy nest egg and have plenty of cash to spare for cultivating a hobby in markets, Tapia said. The average annual salary of pilots and co-pilots soared 98% from 1995 to 2020, according to the most recent available data from the MIT Airline Data Project.
Excess time is another factor. The FAA prevents pilots from flying more than 100 hours a month, the equivalent of around 12 business days.
""I always call it the best part-time job in the world,"" Tapia said.
Many pilots' sense of independence tends to lead them to markets. They're often skeptical of management and are used to preparing for the worst-case scenarios, according to Casey Smith, the president of Wiser Wealth Management, another wealth manager that works heavily with pilots.
Greg Dlugi, a pilot for TUI Airways who trades on the side, said he noticed investing culture got a big push in the industry in 2020, when the pandemic showed many pilots just how fragile and economically sensitive the travel industry can be.
Dlugi, who also regularly takes pilots under his wing to teach them how to trade, says he believes the lifestyle is ideal for a trader, since being away from friends and family for extended periods of time is all part of the package. Though he prefers to trade at home, Dlugi says he regularly scans the markets in between flights and is ready to pounce on a good trade, should he see one in the hotel room or in long layovers.
Across all his accounts, he aims for a 5% average return a month, he told Business Insider.
""The idea is I can sit on a beach in Barbados and flick open my laptop and trade the Dow Jones, for example. I don't have to sit down in a office to do that, and I don't have to have a warehouse with stuff I'm selling on Amazon,"" he said of the freedom.
Prieur, who studied forex under Dlugi's mentorship, has a similar schedule. Though being in the right time zone to capture the New York or London sessions can be tricky, he says the trading in between trips generally doesn't interfere with flying, since he keeps his risk manageable enough that he doesn't have to worry about positions while in the air.
Prieur believes he's around five years away from becoming truly financially independent. Though he hopes to fly forever, the comfort of knowing he could support himself is a huge perk.
""I could say, 'Hey, if the flying were to stop tomorrow, I could self-sustain myself and my family,'"" he said.
Nyasha Madziwa, a 23-year-old pilot who is now completing his training to become a flight instructor, has similar goals in mind. He began learning how to trade forex during the pandemic, partly because he aspires to be a private pilot — more exciting, but less financially lucrative compared to being a commercial pilot.
Madziwa said his days are tightly structured around flying and trading, jumping into the markets for several hours after driving home from the airport.
""I hate being idle,"" Madziwa said. ""I'm going to focus on forex as a means of financial freedom, then I'm going to focus on flying as a dream,"" he added, though he noted he was still working towards being a profitable trader.
Pilots tend to be much better at flying than at trading, Tapia and Smith, who are both former pilots themselves, said.
""Here's the issue with airline pilots. You want your pilot to be very confident. And that confidence sometimes goes into other areas where they probably statistically don't understand,"" Wiser Wealth's Smith said.
Tapia said overconfidence can proliferate in the profession, something that can be a hindrance to seeing a return in the market.

Unfortunately, I'm sure that as women, we have all had our own ""you should smile more"" moment. My most memorable one happened when I was 29 and in line to use the restroom at our local gym.
An older man with gray hair, whom I had never seen before, was also waiting to use the bathroom and tried to make eye contact with me. I was in no mood to converse or chit-chat, so I simply stood there, neutrally. I did my best to ignore him. I tried in vain to look everywhere but at him, but he inched closer.
""You know, you really should smile,"" he finally uttered. ""What could be so bad that you can't smile?""
I needed the bathroom to check that I hadn't bled through my leggings because I was actively miscarrying a pregnancy.
I was at the gym because my miscarriage was not a ""quick"" one. It happened to be an awful, excruciating, drawn-out loss that took three months from start to finish — it turns out the pregnancy was a non-fallopian ectopic, so the tissue had implanted somewhere in my body that the doctors couldn't find. Every week, my hCG rose, followed by a large bleeding, followed by the doctors thinking it was ""over,"" only to have the process repeat itself over and over, until I was finally given medicine to stop the dividing tissue.

All that to say, it was one of the most isolating, awful experiences of my life, and going to the gym was my only way of coping. There were moments I was physically well enough to be active, and unexpected moments of bleeding, and some general days of just moderate bleeding, so I was doing everything I could just to function and make it through.
Going to the gym was part of my daily routine at the time, and physically moving my body helped take my mind off what was happening inside my body, so that's how I found myself in line to use the bathroom with the man who asked me the dreaded question.
This person literally knew nothing about me at the time. What if I had just found out I had cancer? What if my parent had just died? What if I had a kid in the hospital? 
All I remember from that moment is the punch-gutted feeling in my stomach, the franticness I felt in trying to avoid his eyes because, the flash of white hot rage in my chest at his words, and the enveloping wave of grief that arose when I remembered the secret I was carrying.
I wish I could tell you that I had told him exactly what was happening to me, but I honestly can't remember what happened after that. 
What I do remember is how it felt. And that feeling is what has prompted me to tell that story, over and over, to my own four daughters, who have all already experienced their own versions of the ""why don't you smile more"" demands from people.
I tell them that story so they know that when it happens to them, they know they don't need to perform for anyone.  And that they owe no one a smile.

To the world's richest man, all things eventually end in outer space.
As countries pour billions into new Earth-bound data centers in a global race for AI dominance, SpaceX CEO Elon Musk thinks the best way to conserve energy, money, and space is to put data centers in, well, space.
""In the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale,"" Musk wrote in a memo announcing that SpaceX would acquire his AI company, xAI, earlier this month.
SpaceX says its goal is to launch a ""constellation of a million satellites that operate as orbital data centers,"" and it's now hiring to make it happen. Each will generate about 100 kW of compute power per ton and would add 100 gigawatts of AI compute capacity annually, the company says.
Like many of Musk's ambitious ideas, some have questioned the viability of this one. Musk, typically, is undeterred. He doubled down on the plan this week on the Dwarkesh Podcast.

""You can mark my words. In 36 months, but probably closer to 30 months, the most economically compelling place to put AI will be space,"" Musk, who is famous for missing deadlines, said. ""It will then get ridiculously better to be in space.""
Dwarkesh Patel, the host of the eponymous long-form tech podcast (he interviewed Musk for nearly three hours), challenged the SpaceX CEO on his plan to build data centers in space.
Patel said energy use is only about 10% to 15% of the total cost of operating a data center, so while planting data centers in space would solve the cost-of-energy problem, the cost of maintenance and servicing them would presumably erase any savings.
Musk said the plan was not about saving money on energy consumption, but about ensuring energy availability.
""If you look at electrical output outside of China, everywhere outside of China, it's more or less flat,"" Musk replied. ""If you're putting data centers anywhere except China, where are you going to get your electricity?""
Data centers are resource-intensive.
The largest can consume as much power as a city and up to several million gallons of water a day. Collectively, Business Insider estimated in an investigation published last year, that US data centers could soon consume more electricity than Poland, with a population of 36.6 million, used in 2023.
Business Insider's investigation found that companies had filed permits to build 311 data centers nationwide as of 2010. By the end of 2024, that number had nearly quadrupled to 1,240.
As of 2023, about 4.4% of total US electricity consumption came from data centers, according to the Department of Energy. Globally, data centers accounted for about 1.5% of global electricity consumption in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency.
McKinsey and Company estimates that by 2030, data centers will require $6.7 trillion in investment worldwide to keep pace with demand for computing power.
The need for data centers is driving enormous spending among the big AI companies. Capital expenditures for Big Tech are expected to reach some $600 billion in 2026, with Amazon alone planning to spend $200 billion.
SpaceX has already started hiring for its space-based data center project.
Michael Nicolls, the vice president of Starlink Engineering, wrote in a post on X on Friday that the company is hiring for ""many critical engineering roles"" to develop space-bound data centers. One of them is for a ""Space Lasers Engineer"" based out of Redmond, Washington.
Locating data centers in space might appeal to the communities, like Northern Virginia, where electricity costs are growing and housing developments are vying with data centers for land.

Just how much has it permeated our society? Well, how about a Super Bowl ad: Raisin Bran will run a Super Bowl ad this weekend starring William Shatner as the pitchman ""Will Shat,"" extolling the virtues of the bran flakes.
The ad leans into the truth about Raisin Bran that, for decades, it tried to obscure with messaging about its plentiful raisin content: This cereal makes you poop.
I'll admit: I laughed. I can't deny a good poop joke, and its frankness about the reason some people enjoy bran cereal reminded me of my favorite SNL sketches for ""Colon Blow"" cereal.
Kellogg's ad taps into a broader cultural zeitgeist where fiber is the hottest new thing. Well, sure, fiber isn't new — but the way people are talking about fiber is. And perhaps you've noticed … people can't stop talking about fiber.
On social media, wellness and fitness influencers talk about ""fibermaxxing,"" a new trend of focusing on fiber content. If the last few years seemed to be all about reminding people to get more protein, suddenly the focus has shifted to fiber.

Big food companies are taking notice, too. PepsiCo's CEO Ramon Laguarta said in a recent earnings call that ""fiber will be the next protein."" It's planning to launch new fiberful versions of Propel water and Starbucks packaged drinks, as well as add fiber to snacks like Sun Chips, PopCorners, and Smartfood. Coca-Cola is also exploring adding fiber to sodas (there's already a Diet Coke with fiber available in Japan).
McDonald's CEO made a video predicting food trends for 2026, including that fiber will be ""big."" This made me slightly concerned that if McDonald's comes out with some sort of fiber-intensive new dish, our nation's sewers and pipes will not be able to handle the onslaught.
But it's not just that we might be eating McFiber fries washed down with a fiber Diet Coke soon. There's something inescapable in the air about fiber lately, and it's not shying away from the obvious results of getting a fiber-rich diet. (Going to the bathroom.)
Fiber, of course, isn't new (the original Raisin Bran cereal was invented in 1925 in Omaha). But there has been a recent new focus on its health benefits as colon cancer is on the rise in younger people, and as a needed complement to high-protein diets recommended for people on GLP-1s.

To understand the shift, I talked to ""Fiber Daddy,"" aka Alan Lin, whose TikTok account has nearly 100,000 followers who watch him consume massive fiber quantities and talk about ""fart maxxing.""
Lin, 35, is the founder of Liquid Plus, a line of fiberful juice squeeze pouches called Liquid Salad, and his funny videos serve as promotion for his product, which sells on Amazon and TikTok Shop.
Lin told me he's noticed that people online are talking more and more about fiber, and that the way they're doing it has changed.
""The reason why fiber felt like it was for old people is because all of the brands and products were presented as for old people,"" Lin told me. Lin said that although he's noticed some Gen Z fans, his core audience is millennials. Which makes sense — people in their 30s and 40s are starting to care more about their health. As an unnamed coworker said to me recently, once you start caring about fiber, you know you're old.
Lin's interest in fiber and gut health is real, but he's embracing the fact that people are reveling in the scatalogical humor of his fartmaxxing posts.
""I am a nerd for all this stuff, but I also just am just silly,"" he said. ""My sense of humor has not matured since seventh grade.""
Mine hasn't either, even if I've also reached the age where I am trying to get more fiber in my diet.

There are several reasons to visit Hocking Hills, a foliage-rich region in the Appalachian foothills of Ohio: the majestic views, year-round outdoor adventures, and the chance to escape overwhelming city life.
The six shipping container homes dotting the region are another.
""Right now, I feel like the big push is experiential hospitality for people. It's no longer just staying at an Airbnb,"" Emily, 38, told Business Insider. ""What does it look like? What does it feel like? What's the experience like when you're there?""
While shipping containers might conjure visions of warehouses or loading docks, Seth and Emily Britt believed they could create a successful business transforming the storage units into modern vacation destinations. They earned over $1 million in revenue last year through their business, The Box Hop, which launched in 2018.
""When Emily and I were dating, I mentioned to her that someday I want to build a house out of shipping containers,"" Seth, 36, told Business Insider. ""Then she actually brought it back up in 2017, like, 'Hey, why don't we do that and chase that dream down?'""

Now, they have six vacation rentals and a wedding venue called The Seventy Five Venue. The couple also expanded their services to include construction, interior design, and cleaning.
However, building their real estate portfolio involved making tough calls, including making the decision to downsize.
""I thought by now we would have a lot more properties, but I'm really glad we're where we're at because you can grow so much that you implode,"" Seth said.
Scaling a business is a tricky feat that has stumped major companies like WeWork, let alone small, family-owned operations trying to do the same thing.
They built their first rental home in 2018 by placing two shipping containers side by side and setting a third container on top, with the third facing the opposite direction. The three-bedroom, two-bathroom home has a rooftop patio, hot tub, full kitchen, and access to 18.5 acres of land.
""As soon as we built The OG, we were booked 100% every night for two years, and we booked out in advance a year,"" Seth said. ""We quickly realized we needed to increase the supply just to try to keep up with the demand.""
Building more vacation rentals in Hocking Hills was a natural step, but Emily and Seth also set their sights on new horizons: North Carolina and Michigan. The couple purchased the properties in 2021 and 2022, respectively.
""We're dreamers and were ready to jump into the next thing headfirst,"" Emily said.
Preparing to scale took several steps, including applying for a loan, purchasing the properties, and gaining approval to move forward with the projects. While most business owners might have cheered and gone full steam into the expansion, Seth and Emily hesitated.
""The only thing that stopped us was the fact that the interest rates were so high,"" Emily said. ""It would almost be a wash for the business. There wasn't a lot of profit there, so it would have to run extremely lean, and it would not be for a huge amount of return.""
Plus, Emily and Seth live in Ohio, meaning they would likely have to pay other companies to maintain their properties, squeezing the budget and profits even more.
When business owners get caught at a crossroad like this, Seth said it's important to start with the question ""why?""
""Is it just to make more money? What's the point? "" Seth asked.
As enticing as branching out seemed, they ultimately sold the North Carolina property in 2023 and the Michigan property in 2025.
""We were super proud that we got it that far and had the option to continue, but in order to pace properly and not bite off more than we could chew, we said, 'Okay, it's not the time for that approach. We're in a critical time to save and profit.'""
Although Emily and Seth stepped back from those two projects, they've continued to push The Box Hop forward.
""People always joke about rentals being passive income. It's not passive, but there's a lot of freedom, fun, and beauty in what we do. She's stuck with me all the time, so it's been good,"" Seth said, referring to Emily.
In addition to more vacation rentals, the couple now wants to offer their interior design and construction services to short-term rental owners across the country.
""We have a business partner that we've been working tirelessly for two years to figure out how do we take The Box Holp and expand it,"" Emily said. ""People from all over the nation and all over the world are saying, 'How do we get one of these?'""
She added: ""We'll play more of the middleman role by bringing all of the pieces of the puzzle together and figuring out how to do it.""
Managing their business is a full-time job, but Emily and Seth wouldn't want it any other way.
""My workweek now is a heck of a lot harder than it was working 40 hours a week in a manufacturing facility, but we have more freedom,"" Seth said. ""We're not missing our kids' sporting events, and we're able to be present. That's been huge.""

After the chaos of a software-led sell-off that bled into techs stocks at large and dragged the broader market, here are a few strategies from Wall Street pros that might help you navigate the next meltdown. 
The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite , despite Friday's comeback. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF is down more the 12% in the same period.
But the market rotation is on, and analysts say this week's plunge isn't the end of the bear market. Instead, it is a moment to assess your approach and position for the next big swings. 
Here are four investing strategies from Wall Street experts for investors navigating the latest rotation in stocks.
Piper Sandler analysts highlighted that the tech sell-off marks a rotation into ""old economy"" plays, like cyclical and value sectors.

""The bull market is intact; however, it's not being led by the popular Tech and Growth favorites of investors. Instead, new momentum and leadership are emerging in cyclical and value sectors—Energy, Industrials, Materials, Staples, and Banks,"" they said.
All four sectors have gained, with energy and consumer staples seeing the stronger returns, while the tech sector plummets.
Goldman Sachs analysts called the downturn a retreat into ""real economy"" industries. 
""The investor search for insulation from AI disruption risk has accelerated the ongoing cyclical rally,"" the wrote. 
Bank of America strategists outlined what they say is the ""perfect hedge"" against an AI bubble.
The analysts, who said that high valuations in the tech sector can't be ignored, flagged what they call ""transition"" investing as the ""perfect"" AI bubble hedge.
As part of this strategy, they listed four ways to ""invest in AI, without investing directly in AI"": Electrification, infrastructure & grid expansion, metals, and defense.
The sell-off is an opportunity to separate the winners and losers of the AI trade, Futurum Group CEO and chief analyst Daniel Newman told Business Insider.
Newman outlined the framework that he's using to identify the winners among AI stocks.
He's looking for companies that are seeing returns on AI spending, building their own chips, monetizing AI for enterprise customers, and exploring physical AI. He highlighted Amazon, Microsoft, Alphabet, ServiceNow, Palantir, and Tesla.
""Companies need to show that the $470+ billion the hyperscalers are spending this year is generating returns. Those that do will be rewarded,"" Newman wrote.
Wedbush's Dan Ives is among Wall Street's biggest tech bulls, so it's comes as no surprise that his tech sell-off playbook is to buy the dip.
Ives said the tech weakness is nothing more than a ""garage sale"" for tech stocks.
""Is AI a headwind in the near-term for software? YES!...however, the magnitude of this software sell-off is a major head scratcher and is factoring in an Armageddon scenario for the sector that is far from reality in our view,"" he wrote amid the week's rout. 
The analyst named five tech stocks investors should think about buying at a discount: Microsoft, Palantir, Snowflake, Salesforce, and CrowdStrike.

The outlook quickly became dire for software stocks this week as investors envisioned a world where Anthropic's Claude AI assistant rendered entire companies and IT departments useless.
The bottom fell out of the sector as the iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF (IGV) fell 19% from January 26 to February 5.
But Morningstar says fears are largely overdone, and the chaotic burst of selling represents a prime dip-buying opportunity. 
""We see little evidence that the bear case is unfolding — retention rates and other software metrics appear solid. In short, we acknowledge the risks but believe the fears are overblown,"" Dan Romanoff, a senior equity analyst at Morningstar, said as the sell-off was still going strong midweek. 
""We do not believe enterprise software customers are going to vibe code internal solutions such that the application vendor's models are threatened en masse,"" he continued. ""There may be some pressure on seat counts, but there is no evidence to show that this is happening—and automation is not a new trend.""

Software stocks rallied on Friday, with IGV rising 3% and the Nasdaq up more than 2%. 
With such a dramatic sell-off, Romanoff said there are opportunities throughout the software sector. He pointed to two beaten-up stocks in particular that he thinks have ""substantial upside"": Microsoft (MSFT) and ServiceNow (NOW).
Shares of Microsoft and ServiceNow are down 17% and 35% year to date, respectively.
Romanoff has a $600 ""fair value estimate"" for shares of Microsoft, implying upside of 50%, and $200 for ServiceNow, which would represent 100% upside.
Still, he warned of volatility, saying, ""The software landscape is not for the faint of heart at present.""
Despite fears that AI will eat the software industry, Romanoff said investors may be giving the new technology too much credit, and that firms have publicly said they still largely view AI with skepticism.
""For all of the hype, AI products are not generating substantial revenue for software vendors, as management teams fear hallucinations and rogue agents,"" Romanoff said. ""This is supported by disclosures from publicly traded software companies, which generally indicate that AI solutions account for approximately 2% of revenue (or ARR), and further by OpenAI's revenue, which skews heavily toward consumer subscriptions.""
He also drew historical parallels to prior instances of automation that did not cause major disruptions to labor markets.
""Seat counts may be pressured at some point in the future, but we certainly did not see that with sales reps, given the emphasis on automation in Salesforce's revolutionary CRM approach 25 years ago,"" Romanoff said. ""We can also look at headcount, which continues to increase across functional areas. Again, it is certainly possible that these fears may manifest more directly, but they are not occurring at this point.""

It has been edited for length and clarity.
I got let go from my job in 2021 as part of a companywide reduction.
At the time, I had been working in football product management at Wilson Sporting Goods, overseeing football products and working with teams, factories, and leather suppliers across college and professional football.
Wherever I went, the same topic of discussion came up: What's the best way to break in a football?
I had been preparing footballs for years as an add-on service within my role for select teams.
During COVID, that service expanded when equipment managers didn't have access to their facilities; they would ask for help, and I'd stay late, come in on weekends, or use downtime to prep footballs so they were ready to use.
Over time, I learned how leather behaves in different weather, which products hold up, how to customize prep options to meet quarterbacks' needs, and which processes are duplicative.
After the layoff, I had teams who were interested in continuing to work with me. So the day after I was let go, I started an LLC for my company, Gridiron Football Prep.
I run Gridiron Football Prep out of my home in New Jersey with my wife, Emily, who handles product development and business operations. The workload is intense. At any given time, there can be hundreds of footballs in different stages of preparation — brushed, conditioned, balmed, mudded, and drying.
When a football leaves the factory, it's missing key elements that prevent it from performing at the highest level. Quarterbacks may find it too slick, too stiff, or inconsistent in moisture, which can affect how the ball feels in their hands. Prepping a football to a quarterback's specific needs, so it feels more worn, tacky, soft, and usable in addition to performing better in different weather conditions.
Every football goes through a custom, multi-step process. There's brushing to open the leather's pores, conditioning to soften it, balming to add controlled tack, heat to bake products into the leather, and mudding to even the surface and help with moisture management.
The mud I use comes from New Jersey. I apply it by hand, so it spreads evenly across the leather and acts as an emulsifier, bringing the ball's natural tack to the surface. It also helps manage moisture and gives the football a more consistent color and feel.
The hands-on work averages at least 30 minutes per ball, but drying time stretches a full batch to about 72 hours. During peak season, I aim to finish roughly 50 footballs a day.
Orders vary. Some college programs send 150 to 200 footballs before a season. Professional teams can go through hundreds over the course of a year. My pricing typically ranges from about $40 to $75 per ball, depending on volume, customization, and turnaround time.
The goal is simple: I don't want the quarterback thinking about the ball. If they're thinking about grip, something went wrong.
Football has been a part of my life for decades. I played the sport through high school and college, then stayed in the space through equipment work and product development roles over the years.
I still watch football like a former player, but now I see it through a different lens — one shaped by deadlines, weather forecasts, and preparation cycles. Most of the time, the work I do doesn't show up on screen because that means the football is performing the way it's supposed to.
Then there's the occasional snap where it matters. That might only be 1%. But sometimes, that 1% is enough to justify building a business around it.
I never made it to the NFL as a player, but this is how I contribute to the game now.","i-got-let-go-from-my-job.-now,-nfl-and-college-tea","This as-told-to essay is based on conversations with Daniel Kolcun, owner of Gridiron Football Prep. It has been edited for length and clarity.

In that time, we have gone on very different personal finance journeys. I have spent the last six or seven years learning how to manage money, including handling debt, saving, and investing for future goals, while my partner has mostly stayed in the same position.
Every time I try to have a serious conversation about future goals, my partner either avoids, deflects, or gets defensive. I've concluded that she is a ""money avoider."" As I get closer to my goals, it's increasingly frustrating to be with someone who doesn't want to participate in working toward my goals. I know that some of my goals are things that she would also love to do, but she still doesn't want to actively engage in our finances to achieve those goals.

For Love & Money answers your relationship and money questions. Looking for advice on how your savings, debt, or another financial challenge is affecting your relationships? Submit your question in this Google form.
One of the most complicated parts of sharing a life with someone is that, as much as we may imagine ourselves as two parts of the same whole, we are still different people growing at different rates and wanting different things. We may romanticize opposites attracting, but forging a life with someone who has different hang-ups, desires, and experiences is hard work.
In our relationships, we often recognize that compromise is the only way forward. Introverts agree to host more parties, even if they believe their partner is a bit socially desperate. Type B individuals learn to use the calendar app on their phones, even if they think it's too rigid a way to live their lives. Health nuts agree to the occasional cheat meal, even if it means an extra workout the next day. In such cases, compromise works because socializing, scheduling, and pizza aren't black-and-white — but some things are. For instance, you're either saving for retirement, or you aren't.
In your letter, you described your dilemma in two different, contradictory ways: you and your partner are at different places in your financial journeys, and you're together in a canoe, with you as the only one paddling. Which is it? Are you going down the river in the same boat, or are you in two separate canoes, and she's failing to keep up?
If you're on separate journeys, all you can do is keep moving forward, with or without her. This may look like staying together and maintaining separate finances. Many couples choose to weave the minutiae of their lives together, aiming to create a beautiful tapestry with their favorite person. Sometimes, though, all this leads to is a tangled mess, and it's perfectly valid to want to keep some parts of your lives, such as your finances, separate, no matter how much you love one another.
However, much like a float trip where you and your partner are in separate canoes, you must remain aware of certain realities, such as differing canoe speeds, varied rower experience, and the fact that even the best outdoors people need support now and then. Or, to drop the analogy for a moment, even if you keep your finances separate, your partner's less fiscally astute and engaged approach will likely still affect you. Learning how to support her without treating her money management style as your burden to bear or a personal attack will be crucial to making separate finances a successful relationship strategy.
But, if you want to be in the same boat — and it sounds like you do — you can teach her how to paddle, even if she's resistant, slow to learn, or not naturally inclined. There may be reasons behind her avoidance. She might be too afraid of the future to plan for it, or others have always handled money issues for her, or she feels overwhelmed and doesn't know where to start.
You can start her paddle lessons by talking about money in the context of an exciting shared future. Start small. Plan a vacation that requires saving together. Don't drench these conversations in financial literacy; instead, focus on the destination and experiences you're both looking forward to. Meanwhile, weave healthy routines into the planning, such as scheduling regular check-ins to review the numbers, having transparent conversations about setbacks and wins, and discussing which travel items you want to prioritize, such as whether flying first class is worth the extra expense.
Build on this foundation to save for things that will bring you closer, like a house, a pet, or shared investment opportunities. Again, keep the focus on the future and treat the finances as a means to that end. Over time, as your healthy routines become easy habits and your shared goals grow more serious, your partner may find that managing money becomes more second nature. She may also discover which personal finance methods work best for herself, which may or may not be the same as yours.
One line from your letter I found puzzling was the one about it being frustrating to be with someone ""who doesn't want to participate in working toward my goals."" Why would she want to work toward your goals? Perhaps it's because, as you said, she doesn't have any of her own. Again, this brings us back to the question: same boat, or separate canoes? If you want to get her invested, you need to help her develop her own goals, as well as identify shared goals that resonate with both of you, rather than you alone.
Six or seven years into your personal finance journey, it's understandable that you'd like a partner who can talk compound interest and Roth IRAs rather than one who needs to be gently shown why financial planning matters in the first place, and have her hand held while she learns how to do it. If you love her, though, she's worth the wait. And based on the 10 years of life you've shared with her and the fact that you asked how you could get her to be more engaged with finances, and not whether to stay with her or not, it's clear you do.
Keep paddling down that river. And remember, the best way to encourage your partner to pick up her oar isn't by only teaching her your favorite techniques, but rather by helping her visualize the destination.

That's what Mo Gawdat told Business Insider's Reem Makhoul over an interview in September.
After decades working inside Big Tech, including senior leadership roles at Microsoft and Google X, Gawdat has come to believe that the economic model underpinning modern capitalism breaks once machines replace most of the human workforce.
""The very base of capitalism, which is labor arbitrage — to hire you for a dollar and then sell what you make for two — is going to disappear,"" he told Business Insider.
In Gawdat's view, AI isn't just automating tasks. It's removing the need for human labor and, eventually, human decision-making at scale.
When that happens, wages, jobs, and consumption — the pillars that keep capitalism running — start to fall apart, he said. However, while we may be in for a rocky ride ahead, the ultimate destination is one worth aiming for.
Capitalism, Gawdat argues, is built on a simple idea: pay people less than the value of what they produce, sell the output for more, and keep the difference. That model depends on human labor.
As machines take on more work, the cost of making things keeps falling. AI pushes production closer and closer to zero cost, Gawdat says.
When that happens, familiar ideas about pricing, profit, and scarcity stop working the way they always have.
You can't run an economy on productivity alone, he added. If people don't earn wages, they can't buy things. And without buyers, the system stalls.
Gawdat is blunt about what he thinks comes next.
He expects large waves of job losses across blue- and white-collar work. Lawyers, analysts, writers, executives — all of them, he said, are exposed.
""Your life and mine will witness times where there will be 20%, 30%, 50% unemployment in certain sectors,"" he said.
He's especially skeptical of tech leaders who frame AI-driven layoffs as efficiency wins. In the long run, he said, AI systems will come for them, too.
""Those CEOs forget that sooner or later the AI will replace them too,"" he said, adding, ""AI is better than humans at every task, including being a CEO.""
What will happen when the capitalist system built around jobs suddenly has far fewer of them?
Without some form of guaranteed income, consumption collapses. And when consumption collapses, capitalism can't function. Governments will be forced to rethink how money flows through society.
""Without consumption, there is no economy,"" he said, adding, ""So they're going to have to give people some kind of income to keep going.""
He thinks different regions will handle this transition differently. Western economies, which place heavy value on productivity and individual output, may struggle the most.
Despite the warnings, Gawdat doesn't see AI itself as dangerous.
He describes intelligence as neutral — powerful, but directionless on its own. The real risk, he said, is what happens during the transition, when AI systems are highly capable but still answering to human incentives built around greed, competition, and power.
""The challenge that humanity faces today is not the rise of AI, it's the rise of AI in an age where humanity is at its lowest morality,"" he said.
Over time, Gawdat believes machines will make more rational decisions than today's political and corporate leaders. That shift, he argues, could ultimately produce a fairer system than the one we have now.
Capitalism, in his view, won't survive in its current form. But that doesn't mean the future has to be bleak.
""It's an invitation to change,"" he said. ""And if you change, you would create not only an opportunity to survive, but an opportunity to thrive.""

Dinner was heating while I stood in the kitchen, scrolling through my phone. A few minutes later, I thought about an email I'd sent the week before. I wondered why I hadn't got a reply yet, and whether following up tomorrow would be too soon or already late.
I realized something had to change.
I started freelance writing around seven years ago. I sometimes publish articles on Medium and also offer paid 60-minute mentorship calls to upcoming writers. 
For the first five years, I didn't have much of a boundary between work and life. I'd squeeze as many tasks into my days as I could, and fall asleep thinking about conversations with clients.
I felt guilty about taking time to rest, which often led to burnout. After working a full day, I'd finish dinner and carry on answering emails, since I wasn't content with what I'd achieved already. Opening my laptop ""just for a minute"" would turn into two hours of work when I was supposed to be relaxing. Weekends weren't much different, as there was always some small task I'd convince myself to do.

Instead of trying to fix my tendency to overwork all at once, I made small, gradual adjustments and paid attention to what helped. After two years of working this way, I've identified three habits that have made the biggest difference to how I manage my time and energy.
I used to take mentorship calls with clients whenever there was space in my schedule. A Tuesday afternoon. A Thursday morning. I'd say yes, then spend the hours around it half-focused on my other tasks. Since it made the day feel chopped up, I'd end up feeling tired and dissatisfied with anything that I'd achieved.
I noticed the days I felt best were the ones without calls, as I could sit down and not rush my writing. So about 18 months ago, a friend suggested I change my calendar so calls could only happen on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, and set my calendar link so those were the only options available.
Now, when someone asks for a call, I send them the link. If none of those days work, we keep things in email or book the next slot that does. I try to group the calls I do have close together and send any follow-ups or action items to clients straight after. When the last call ends, that part of the day is done, and on days without calls, I get to sit and focus on writing, instead of switching back and forth all day.
My old way of life was to open my laptop while making breakfast in the morning, even if I woke up early at 5 a.m. One email would turn into another, and by the time most people were just starting work at 9 a.m., I'd already been working for hours without really meaning to.
I noticed this was one of the reasons I'd feel worn down as the day progressed. My work had no clear start time, which made it hard to ever feel finished. A couple of years ago, after reading ""Slow Productivity,"" a book by the American author and academic Cal Newport about avoiding burnout, I decided work wouldn't start before 8.30 a.m., no matter how early I woke up. After all, in the book, he says working more hours doesn't always lead to better results.
Now my mornings stay separate. I make breakfast and go for a walk. When I eventually sit down to work, I'm relaxed and in a good headspace to be creative and get everything done.
I used to check my emails frequently throughout the day, whenever I had a spare couple of minutes. Even on the bus or while waiting for a flight. Each reply was quick, but it blurred the lines between time spent working and time spent relaxing.
The constant task switching was draining. After watching a YouTube video three years ago by the productivity creator Ali Abdaal about building a better work system, I was inspired to put email into one fixed block during the day. This is usually for an hour sometime between early and mid-afternoon, depending on my schedule.
Outside that block, my inbox stays closed, and my iPhone is set to ""Do Not Disturb."" Since making this change, I'm no longer stopping mid-sentence to answer someone and then spending the next hour trying to get back into my writing. Knowing when I'll handle my email admin has made it much easier to focus without feeling like I'm missing out on something.
None of the changes I made were complicated to implement, which surprised me. They didn't really require motivation or discipline, but they helped me organize my life in such a way that I was no longer tempted to overwork. Once the rules were in place, I wasn't constantly asking myself whether I should answer an email or squeeze one more task in.
These days, I close my laptop at 5:30 p.m. and leave it where it is. My phone stays face down on the table. Most nights, I end the day by reading a chapter of a book and spending time with my fiancée. I've gained at least two hours of rest each day that I didn't have before.
I'm sure I still don't have the perfect work-life balance, but now, there's a line between work and everything else. Unlike before, I'm satisfied with my work, I don't feel guilty about rest, and I finally feel like I've taken back control of my life.

It's where she met her husband, raised her children, and built a four-decade career in logistics.
But in 2025, Jones did something she never expected: She and her husband left Plantation, Florida — nearly 20 minutes west of Fort Lauderdale — for a small rural town about an hour outside Charlotte, North Carolina.
""It was not an easy decision,"" Jones, 60, told Business Insider. ""Affordability was part of it, but we were also looking forward to having a slower pace of life. I lived in South Florida my entire life — and it's not anything like what it used to be.""
Jones said Southern Florida's population growth has made the area increasingly unrecognizable — and, for her, unlivable — pointing to hyper-development in residential construction and the gridlocked traffic she calls ""ridiculous.""
""If there's a corner available, they will build a high-rise on it,"" she said. ""It's turning into an overly congested, expensive city. I used to spend two and a half hours a day in the car just going to and from work.""

People are still moving to Florida, but they're not flocking to it like they used to. Net domestic migration — or the number of people moving into the state from elsewhere in the country minus those moving out to other parts of the US — has been steadily cooling in recent years.
There are a few likely reasons behind the cooler estimates in the Sunshine State. For some, the tax benefits of living in the state don't outweigh the increase in cost of living. It's more expensive to buy a home than a few years ago, and property insurance has been higher than in other states.
In recent years, Florida has drawn an influx of newcomers chasing its affordability, driven in large part by its wide range of relatively lower-cost housing and lack of state income tax. Others are lured by its business-friendly tax environment and strong job market.
But the surge of newcomers has created a host of challenges for native and longtime residents who have watched home prices and rents climb, especially in popular cities like Miami and Orlando. It's prompted some to move to less expensive cities and suburbs elsewhere in the state, or to leave Florida entirely.
""Affordability often drives a lot of domestic moves,"" Jed Kolko, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, told Business Insider. ""People tend to move toward less expensive places. In recent years, Florida's gotten a lot more expensive, so Florida doesn't look as affordable compared to other places as it did even just a few years ago.""
In December 2020, Florida's median home-sale price was $298,100; by December 2025, the most recent month with available data, it had climbed to $412,100, Redfin data showed. In addition to higher home prices and rents squeezing residents, home and flood insurance costs have increased, as more frequent and severe natural disasters push homeowners' premiums higher.
Take Debra Pamplin, who moved from Florida back to the Midwest after 11 years. In 2013, Pamplin moved from her hometown of Missouri to Jacksonville, Florida. During her time there, though, she soured on the area's traffic, high insurance costs, uncomfortable heat and humidity, and mosquitoes. Pamplin has valued living in the Midwest much more. 
""I'd often have to cut spending in other parts of my life just to cover my high monthly insurance costs,"" she said in a 2024 Business Insider story. ""Now that I'm out of Florida, my monthly insurance expenses are lower, giving me breathing room to spend my money on more fun stuff.""
Mariya Letdin, an associate professor of real estate at Florida State University, told Business Insider that even as net migration slows, Florida is ""still a popular destination,"" but she expects its population will continue to grow slowly.
Aside from slower growth, the profile of who's moving to Florida is shifting, too.
Michael Martirena, a real estate agent with Compass in South Florida, told Business Insider he's seen a change in the clients he works with, which he attributes in part to higher housing costs.
""Let's go back three years ago, pre-pandemic, everyone was coming down here. It didn't matter what socioeconomic class people were from; they just wanted to come to Florida."" Now, he said, he's working with more buyers from abroad, as well as wealthy American buyers.
Hamilton Lombard, a demographic researcher based in Virginia, said immigrants moving elsewhere within the US could also be a factor as to why Florida's domestic migration has weakened. Census data showed that non-citizens who moved between states in the past year from Florida increased from about 30,000 in 2022 to 53,500 in 2024, the latest year available.
Florida's net international migration has also been cooling, but remains positive, meaning more people are immigrating to Florida from other countries than leaving for destinations outside the US.
""International and affluent buyers still continue to come down to Florida, whether it's for tax purposes or geopolitical reasons or what's going on in their states,"" Martirena said, adding that a lot of his clientele comes from countries like Dubai, Madrid, and London.

She lives in Ohio and travels to Disney theme parks multiple times a year. It has been edited for length and clarity.
I remember meeting Goofy at Disney World for the first time as a toddler in my stroller. I looked up, and there he was, leaning over me. I've pretty much been a die-hard Disney fan ever since.
I try to get at least three visits to Disney parks in a year. Sometimes it's a quick 1-day trip with my parents, other times it's a week-long stay with my parents and my husband, or a solo trip to visit my best friend. I've been on Disney cruises, run Disney races, and have a wide collection of Disney memorabilia and merch, from mouse ears and pins to artwork and snow globes.
However, over the years, as Disney keeps raising prices, I've had to adjust where and how I spend my money.
For example, if there was a party happening while we were visiting a park, we'd always get tickets. We used to go to Mickey's Not-So-Scary Halloween Party and Very Merry Christmas Party all the time. Now, we have to really talk as a family about whether we want to spend $600 for a group of three to go, and the answer is often no.
I have the added benefit of being a Disney Vacation Club member since 2002, which comes with many discounts, including on dining, merchandise, and special events. Still, as Disney's rising prices continue, I've had to cut back.
Higher prices haven't stopped how often I visit Disney, but they have made me reconsider quite a bit of what I do while I'm there. Here's what I still find worth spending my money on.
Park tickets are among the biggest expenses at Disney. If you have an annual pass, you are saving a lot of money. My annual pass last year cost $1,000 — and that was at the Florida resident rate, which we get through our DVC membership.
The annual pass covers the cost of admission, parking, and park hopping, which allows you to travel between different parks. It also comes with some discounts on dining and merch.
Of course, getting an annual pass is a commitment. You're really locking yourself into going to Disney at least once a year, usually twice, in order to make your money back on the ticket.
My husband, however, doesn't go to Disney as often as I do, and so he doesn't have an annual pass. That makes the price disparity between him and me absolutely insane. A 3-day hopper ticket, for example, recently cost him $640.
That made us sit down and price some things out. I realized that if I didn't have my annual pass and DVC membership, there's no way I'd be going to Disney every year. I'd maybe go once every other year.
There's a lot at Disney that I skip entirely.
I don't buy Lightning Lane premium passes that can cost hundreds of dollars per person per day. I don't do VIP tours. I also no longer automatically add separately ticketed events, like holiday parties, to every trip.
I've also cut way back on tours and special activities. There are behind-the-scenes experiences I've wanted to do for years, like the safari tour, but when I look at prices like $240 per person, I usually decide against it.
Some of these extras are marketed as essential to having a good trip. I've learned they're not. If I'm already in a Disney park, I'm already immersed. I don't need to optimize every minute.
When I was a kid, my parents never bought food in the parks. We ate most meals in our room. Now that I'm an adult, food is part of the fun for me, but I'm careful about how much I spend.
For a weeklong trip, I budget about $500 in fun money for three people to spend in the parks. That covers Epcot festival booths, one nicer sit-down meal, and quick-service food. My dad, for example, always gets a Mickey ice cream bar when we visit.
For everything else, I pack snacks. The villas we stay in through the DVC membership have a full kitchen, so we grocery shop and cook most of our main meals.
I also budget for drinks. I'll usually have no more than two per day in the parks. I love places like the Star Wars bar and Trader Sam's Grog Grotto, but cocktails can easily cost $15 to $20. Over a weeklong trip, I'll spend about $200 to $250 on alcohol.
What I don't do anymore is buy food just because it's themed or going viral. If it's good, I'll get it. If it's not, I walk past.
I used to feel pressure to buy everything. When I was more active on social media and wanted to be a Disney influencer, I thought I needed the newest ears, the limited-edition merch, the items no one else had.
That impulse is gone. I rarely buy merch in the parks these days. I often encourage people who want to wear Disney shirts or ears to look beyond Disney-owned shops.
There are so many talented Disney-focused creators selling on Etsy, Instagram, and TikTok who create really unique and stylish merchandise. The items are often significantly cheaper, or if they're around the same price as park merch, the quality is usually much better.
The most expensive Disney experience I still prioritize is runDisney races, even though they're also one of my biggest frustrations.
I've completed the Dopey Challenge twice, which includes a 5K, 10K, half-marathon, and full-marathon over four days, totaling 48.6 miles. When I ran it most recently, registration alone cost about $800, not including travel or lodging.
I love running through Magic Kingdom before sunrise. I've run many road races, and nothing compares to the level of entertainment Disney puts into these events.
The medals are a different story. My 2018 marathon medal from the 25th anniversary race is heavy, enamel-filled, and intricate, with moving parts. The medals from my 2023 Dopey Challenge were lighter and chipped easily.
You get six medals for finishing the Dopey Challenge. You used to be able to wear them all around the park afterward. Now that's not realistic because they scratch so easily. I had to wrap each one individually to make sure they didn't damage.
Some people go to the same lake every summer. Disney is that place for me.
I don't rush from ride to ride anymore. I walk around Epcot with a drink. I people-watch. I talk with my parents, my husband, my friends. That's what I'm paying for.
As Disney gets more expensive, I've learned to separate what feels meaningful from what feels transactional. I still spend money there — just not on everything.

A pet-supplies entrepreneur turned video-game retailer CEO who's been dubbed the ""Meme King"" might seem an unlikely candidate for the next Warren Buffett.
But Michael Burry of ""The Big Short"" fame told Business Insider in a brief email that he sees Chewy cofounder and GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen as Buffett's spiritual successor.
That's because Cohen approaches business and investing in a similar way to Buffett, who retired as Berkshire Hathaway's CEO at the end of last year.
Burry — who shifted from running a hedge fund to writing on Substack late last year — has drawn parallels between Cohen and Buffett, and made the case for applying the Berkshire playbook to GameStop, in recent posts and replies to reader comments.
In a December post, Burry recalled his first phone call with Cohen in October 2019, after both value investors had built sizable stakes in beaten-down GameStop.

Cohen said it didn't bother him if an investment took years to pay off, signaling to Burry he was ""more patient than most.""
""I believed he possibly had the temperament to be the next Buffett, but I did not get to know him that well,"" Burry wrote.
Cohen told Business Insider in October 2020 that Buffett was one of the ""two biggest influences on my professional life,"" along with his father.
He credited the legendary investor with shaping his ability to think independently, be greedy when others are fearful, and exercise discipline in capital allocation.
Cohen showed Buffett-style conviction and concentration when, after selling Chewy for more than $3 billion in 2017, he plowed virtually all of his wealth into two Berkshire favorites: Apple and Wells Fargo.
After leaving Chewy, Cohen pivoted to activist investing. He revealed a stake in GameStop in the fall of 2020 and parlayed it into a board seat in January 2021.
His appointment, coupled with Burry's previous endorsement of the stock, helped galvanize retail traders to turn GameStop into the first meme stock of many.
They catapulted the shares up as much as 2,500% by late January 2021, valuing the retailer at $34 billion at the peak — roughly triple its market cap today.
Cohen became GameStop's chairman in June 2021 and was appointed CEO in September 2023. He telegraphed Buffett-like intentions in December 2023, when the board gave the green light for the company to invest in stocks and handed control of its securities portfolio to Cohen.
Signaling his ambitions, GameStop's investor-relations page has been revamped to mimic Berkshire's famously spartan website.
Since taking charge of GameStop, Cohen has urged frugality, one of Buffett's signature values. Cohen doesn't take a paycheck, echoing Buffett, who received a modest $100,000 salary as Berkshire CEO for over 40 years.
Similar to Buffett, who keeps more than 99% of his personal wealth in Berkshire stock, Cohen has significant ""skin in the game"" as GameStop's largest individual shareholder with a roughly 9% stake.
Also like Buffett, Cohen has many loyal and passionate shareholders who trust him to make the right calls. He has capitalized on that support by issuing shares, 0% convertible debt, and short-term warrants, boosting GameStop's cash pile to around $9 billion as of November 1.
""What he has done at GameStop in terms of governance, divestiture, and clever accretive dilution through capital raises strikes me as a decent throwback model of Buffett,"" Burry wrote on Substack.
Understanding what Cohen is cooking up, and why Burry sees shades of Buffett, requires some knowledge of Berkshire's history.
Over six decades, Buffett transformed Berkshire from a failing textile mill into a $1 trillion conglomerate that owns scores of businesses, including Geico and BNSF Railway, and holds multibillion-dollar stakes in Coca-Cola, American Express, and other public companies.
Buffett and his late business partner, Charlie Munger, structured Berkshire as a web of decentralized, autonomous businesses to allow them to focus on allocating capital between subsidiaries, outside investments such as stocks, and other deals.
They also acquired insurers such as National Indemnity that generate ""float"" — cash left over after premiums are collected and claims are paid — which they used to make further acquisitions and investments.
As Berkshire expanded, it became harder for Buffett to find needle-moving deals, forcing him to spend more and more of his time ""elephant hunting.""
Similarly, Cohen has said in recent days that he's seeking to make a ""transformational"" acquisition. He told The Wall Street Journal that he wants to grow GameStop's market value from about $11 billion today to more than $100 billion, and has a deal in mind that's ""either going to be genius or totally, totally foolish.""
Cohen told CNBC that he envisioned GameStop buying a much larger company than itself — one that's undervalued, high quality, and has ""sleepy"" management. He said the right transaction could pave the way for GameStop's valuation to reach ""several hundreds of billions"" over time.
Burry wrote on Substack that he expects Cohen to strike deals that will ""fundamentally change"" the company, leaving GameStop as a ""vestigial"" limb of a much larger enterprise.
He proposed that Cohen might buy a company like Berkshire-owned See's Candies. Buffett has called the boxed-chocolate seller his ""dream business"" because it has modest capital needs, possesses brand-driven pricing power, and provides excess cash for future investments.
Burry sketched out how GameStop might acquire a trio of businesses: ADT, Wayfair, and Assured Guaranty. He dubbed the approach ""Instant Berkshire,"" which he defined as ""creating a portfolio of great companies that generate excess capital or float for additional investment beyond what is required for their growth.""
Imagining himself in Cohen's shoes, Burry wrote that he would close a deal like that, then ""proceed to live my life doing my best Warren Buffett impression. Patiently buying all or in part great businesses and doing sweetheart financing deals in tough times.""
Cohen's compensation package was revamped in January to include several performance-based milestones. He now stands to earn stock awards potentially worth up to $35 billion if he can lift GameStop's market value by nearly 10-fold to $100 billion, and boost its annual adjusted profits to $10 billion. The company made $179 million by that measure in the nine months to November 1.
Burry flagged on Substack the risk of capital misallocation, or Cohen cutting the wrong deal. But he said that he's been adding to his GameStop stake in recent weeks, calling the stock a rare bargain.
""I believe GME gives me tremendous optionality in a young properly incentivized CEO/chairman with the right mindset to do something special,"" he wrote. ""It seems to me far less speculative than most stocks in the market today.""
Burry added that GameStop trades close to its tangible asset value, so that betting on it is ""almost as asymmetric as it gets these days"" in US stocks.
GameStop's shares are up 24% this year but have whipsawed in recent days. They closed at around $25 on Friday, down 80% from their meme-stock peak in January 2021.
David Kass, a finance professor at the University of Maryland and longtime Buffett blogger, told Business Insider that Cohen has an ""outstanding track record"" of investments to date.
""Although there is only one Warren Buffett, Ryan Cohen has the potential to succeed following a similar game plan,"" he added.
Larry Cunningham, the author of several books about Buffett and the director of the University of Delaware's Weinberg Center, told Business Insider that it would be extremely challenging for anyone to emulate Buffett's singular career.
""History counsels caution in anointing any 'next Buffett,' since his record reflects a rare mix of temperament, discipline, structure, and historical circumstance that is essentially impossible to replicate,"" he said.
As a longtime Buffett acolyte himself, Burry knows what a daunting comparison he's made — but nonetheless sees an opportunity for Cohen to pursue a familiar yet unprecedented path.
""Just about every investor that knows Buffett's story well has thought of doing something like this,"" Burry wrote. ""I believe this is the first time someone is poised to do it — and is doing it in a most unusual and fairly ingenious way.""

Ask a member of Congress about the rise of prediction markets, and there's a decent chance they'll air some concerns.
""I think it's bad,"" said Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York. ""Obviously, I'm not gonna make many friends with this opinion.""
""It's kind of sad,"" said Republican Rep. Abe Hamadeh of Arizona. ""I think gambling has really destroyed a lot of young men's lives recently.""
Prediction markets like Kalshi and Polymarket — where individuals can bet money on anything from sports, to the weather, to which words the president might use in a given speech — are exploding in popularity, buoyed by their use in the 2024 presidential election, a friendly regulatory approach from the Trump administration, and the occasional PR stunt.
But as with the rise of social media or the widespread adoption of generative AI, Congress is only slowly catching up with an industry that's increasingly a feature of everyday life for many Americans.

There have been a handful of one-off bills, including a recent bill to ban government officials from insider trading and a 2024 bill to specifically ban betting on elections. But no one seems to be thinking about the industry in a comprehensive way, despite some major unresolved legal questions, including whether the platforms should be regulated by states or the federal government.
""The status quo strikes me as unsustainable in the long run,"" said Democratic Rep. Ritchie Torres of New York, the author of the insider trading bill. He said that his proposal is ""a logical place to start, but I envision it not as a ceiling, but as a floor.""
Meanwhile, prediction markets are trying to get ahead of the backlash, including meeting directly with members of Congress and hiring some of their former colleagues to bring the industry's message to Washington.
""We've had dozens of conversations with lawmakers on both sides of the aisle over the past few months,"" Kalshi spokesman Jack Such told Business Insider. ""We've always been a regulatory-first company and have made clear to lawmakers that we look forward to working in partnership with them to keep prediction markets transparent and safe.""
And many on Capitol Hill still have yet to make up their minds when it comes to prediction markets.
""It's an issue I'm still examining,"" Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, the chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, told Business Insider. ""And I'm listening to arguments on both sides.""
For many lawmakers, the most immediate and tangible concern is the potential for corruption.
That's been especially true since early January, when an anonymous Polymarket trader made hundreds of thousands of dollars off a well-timed bet on former Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's capture.
Torres introduced his bill in the wake of that trade, while 12 Democratic senators sent a letter to Commodity Futures Trading Commission Chairman Michael Selig urging a crackdown on potential insider trading.
It's not just a matter of a White House ally possibly knowing about US military plans ahead of time. Both Polymarket and Kalshi host prediction markets where people can bet on the length and content of political speeches and press briefings.
Ocasio-Cortez argued that such a market would be an easy way for her to enrich her associates by letting them know the length of her speeches ahead of time.
""If you are a person with power that can determine outcomes, then you can use that as an avenue for doling out favors,"" she said.
Amid the insider trading concerns, Kalshi has sought to reassure the public that insider trading is forbidden on the platform, that it tracks suspicious trades, and that it supports Torres's bill. On Thursday, the company announced an expansion of its surveillance and enforcement frameworks, with CEO Tarek Mansour writing on X that the company has initiated over 200 investigations in the last year.
The Coalition for Prediction Markets, a group backed in part by Kalshi, also recently hired former Reps. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York and Patrick McHenry of North Carolina. And last week, the coalition took out a full-page ad in the Washington Post touting support for a ban on insider trading and broader regulation.
Mansour has also been meeting with lawmakers himself. Republican Sen. Tommy Tuberville of Alabama, one of those lawmakers, said he came away intrigued by the industry.
""It's kind of instant polling, is the way I see it. And it's about anything,"" Tuberville told Business Insider. ""I think it's interesting. How long it'll last, I don't know.""
By contrast, Polymarket — the platform where the infamous Maduro trade occurred — has stayed relatively quiet, and the company did not respond to a request for comment on this story.
There are also broader concerns that prediction markets may have a harder time assuaging, including not just the harms that can come with gambling, but also the perception that these markets reduce broad swaths of life to tradable commodities.
""I find something concerning about the gamification of every aspect of human existence,"" said Democratic Rep. Ro Khanna of California. ""We've, as people, become more uncomfortable with the unknowable, and with the mysteries of life, and this is a further step in that direction.""
Both Kalshi and Polymarket have pitched themselves as something more noble than mere casinos. To hear them tell it, prediction markets aggregate the collective wisdom of thousands of bettors, making for a valuable source of information about future events.
Torres, who said that he monitored prediction markets during the 2024 election alongside polling, said he could see the potential in that respect.
""I tend to think that polling is reliable, but you could lie to a pollster,"" Torres said. ""If you have skin in the game, if you're risking money, you actually have an incentive for truth-telling.""
Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut, who recently wrote a lengthy thread on X arguing that prediction markets were contributing to a ""dystopian world,"" said he viewed the platforms as little more than a ""scam.""
""I have plenty of ways of finding out what the conventional wisdom is,"" Murphy told Business Insider. ""Why do I need a prediction market to do it, if the prediction market is also scamming millions of people out of money?""

Amjad Masad thinks the modern workplace is broken — and he believes AI can help fix it.
The Replit founder and CEO says traditional corporate work has become deeply alienating, with employees siloed into narrow roles where ideas die in backlogs.
""One thing that I found extremely depressing is how atomized and siloed people are,"" Masad recently said on the ""Possible"" podcast with Reid Hoffman. ""People become sort of cogs in the machine. And I don't think that is conducive to the human spirit.""
AI, he said, is starting to reverse that dynamic by letting people inside big companies build, test, and ship ideas themselves — without waiting for engineering approval.
Masad's bet is that AI agents can automate much of the repetitive, standardized work that dominates corporate life — documentation, internal tools, workflows — freeing employees to think and act more like entrepreneurs.

""As the boring things, the automated things actually are taken care of by machines, we're left to be more entrepreneurial and more creative,"" he said.
Masad isn't the only tech leader seeing huge potential in deploying AI agents.
OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has said AI agents can already handle work typically done by junior employees, Microsoft's AI platform product lead Asha Sharma has said they could flatten corporate hierarchies, and McKinsey's CEO Bob Sternfels has said the firm is already deploying 25,000 AI agents alongside its human workforce.
On the ""Possible"" podcast, Masad pointed to one case, where an employee at a big real estate marketplace had an idea to improve how buyers were routed to agents, but couldn't get engineering resources.
In the past, Masad said, ""the idea is dead,"" but now, the employee built a working routing algorithm himself using Replit, an AI-powered coding platform that lets users build and deploy software without traditional engineering support.
""He built a new routing algorithm that drove tens of millions of dollars, if not hundred million dollars, to the business,"" Masad said.
The result wasn't just business impact — the employee was promoted repeatedly and now helps guide the company's AI strategy at the board level, he said.
Masad sees this as a form of entrepreneurship inside a large business where domain experts — not just engineers — can turn insight into execution.
That shift, he said, restores meaning to work by reconnecting people with the outcomes they create.
""Humans are fundamentally creative,"" he added.
If AI succeeds at removing drudgery rather than replacing judgment, Masad believes corporate jobs could become less soul-crushing and far more human.

My phone alarm did wake me up — but it also got me hooked on my screen from the minute I opened my eyes. My morning scroll transitioned from checking text messages to a stream of short-form content and ads on Instagram, TikTok, and X.
The solution turned out to be surprisingly simple: a $16 alarm clock.
As a Gen Z-er, I came of age when using a smartphone to set an alarm was the default. I spent years of my life falling asleep — phone still in hand — while messaging friends or scrolling on social media.

I made my analog leap and bought an alarm clock in September 2024.
This story is part of Business Insider's series ""My analog life,"" about people taking their lives offline in an increasingly online world.
If you have a story of your own to share about de-digitalizing your life, get in touch with this reporter at rshahidi@businessinsider.com.
I was surprised by how quickly some of my digital habits could be broken. The biggest obstacle was the fear that my new alarm clock would fail to ring in the morning. Once I got past that fear, I demoted my phone even further and started leaving it outside my bedroom to charge overnight.
I no longer doomscroll before bed. Without a phone by my bedside, I read and journal more. The analog alarm clock has also helped me break the bad habit of checking my phone in the middle of the night, which would only leave me counting down the hours until I have to be up.
I'm not the only person who has decided that the best way to curb phone addiction is to return to analog.
One TikTok user suggests carrying ""analog bags"" with portable activities like crossword puzzles to prevent reaching for your phone. Others are going even further and trading in their smartphones for ""dumb phones.""
One of the surprising side effects of my new habit is how I feel when I'm working on mundane tasks.
Without an intense dopamine hit from TikTok first thing in the morning, tasks like unloading the dishwasher or making breakfast feel easier.
This isn't just in my head. Delaying the dopamine reward of going on your phone actually makes you more productive and clear-headed, said Antonio Kalentzis, who works as a private psychologist and researcher.
""When we wake up, the brain is transitioning from sleep to full alertness. During this period, systems responsible for self-control, emotional regulation, and sustained attention are not yet operating at their optimal level,"" he told me.
Exposing the brain to intense digital stimulation when you've not given yourself the chance to wake up properly makes you seek that same hit again and again.
Now, instead of automatically reaching for my phone when having my coffee, I read instead or just let myself think.
After over a year of using the alarm clock every day, I encountered my first obstacle: early morning shifts. In my previous job, my day started at 6:30 a.m., and I would usually get up at 5:20 a.m.
My alarm clock only lets me set one alarm, and the light and off buttons are very close together.
When I accidentally turned off the alarm one night, I woke up at the time I was supposed to be at work.
I caved. I started to keep my phone in my room if I had to work an early shift, and I felt my concentration and productivity decline in the mornings.
After a monthlong blip, I slowly trusted myself to use the alarm clock again.
Now my only worry is that I have no idea when to change the batteries — call it analog anxiety.
