Two Team USA athletes are speaking out about what it means to them to represent their country before the rest of the world amid a season of political turmoil at home.
While several athletes skirted around the question of politics with diplomatic answers about representing personal values at the 2026 Winter Olympics, freestyle skiers Chris Lillis and Hunter Hess acknowledged that wearing red, white and blue at this point in history comes with mixed emotions during a press conference on Friday, Feb. 6.
Lillis, 27, said that he loves the United States and “would never want to represent” any other country at the Games. Still, he acknowledged that he’s “heartbroken” over what’s happening in the U.S. amid President Trump’s aggressive immigration crackdown.
“A lot of times, athletes are hesitant to talk about political views and how we feel about things. I feel heartbroken about what’s happening in the United States,” he said. “I’m pretty sure you’re referencing ICE and some of the protests and things like that. I think that as a country, we need to focus on respecting everybody’s rights and making sure that we’re treating our citizens as well as anybody, with love and respect.”
He continued, “I hope that when people look at athletes competing in the Olympics, they realize that that’s the America that we’re trying to represent.”
Hess, meanwhile, said it “brings up mixed emotions” to represent the United States at the 2026 Games.
“It’s a little hard. There’s obviously a lot going on that I’m not the biggest fan of, and I think a lot of people aren’t,” the skier, 27, said. “I think for me, it’s more I’m representing my friends and family back home… all the things that I believe are good about the United States.”
Hess noted that “just because I wear the flag, it doesn’t mean I represent everything that is going on in the U.S.”
“I just kind of want to do it for my friends and my family and the people that support me getting here,” he said.
The immigration conversation in the U.S. has become heated in recent months, especially after the shooting deaths of Renee Good and Alexi Pretti by federal agents in Minnesota.
ICE tactics — including the nearly two-week detainment of a 5-year-old boy — have drawn outrage from some, prompting protests nationwide and abroad. Citizens of Milan, the main home of the 2026 Winter Olympics, staged an anti-ICE protest on Friday, Feb. 6, while Vice President JD Vance’s appearance at the opening ceremony later that day prompted boos from the crowd when he was shown on screen at the stadium.

Paris Hilton says motherhood gives her a spring in her step.
The reality star recently caught up with PEOPLE exclusively at the pre-Grammys gala in Beverly Hills, Calif. During the conversation, she discussed the release of her new documentary, Infinite Icon: A Visual Memoir, as well as how parenting her two kids, son Phoenix, 3, and daughter London, 2 keeps her going amid a crazy schedule.
“It's been a lot. It's been nonstop,” Hilton, 44, said of promoting the new doc, which tracks her personal journey from tabloid obsession to cultural icon. “I've been all over and I just love what I do.”
“I feel really blessed that I get to do so many things I love. And my babies give me energy, so just being with them and cuddling with them, it just makes me feel like I'm so lucky and just so energized,” she added.
The heiress and businesswoman has previously opened up about how motherhood has transformed her life.
“Being a mom, it’s the most beautiful thing I have ever experienced,” she says in her new doc.
“[It’s] the kind of love that’s so deep, it changes you forever. When I look at my baby’s faces, I see everything I was ever meant to be. London and Phoenix are my whole heart, my ‘cutesie crew,’ ” she adds.

“Every smile, every cuddle, every little moment with them feels like pure magic,” Hilton continues, adding, “They’ve given my life a new kind of sparkle — one that’s deeper, softer and so full of love it takes my breath away.” 
Hilton said that she knew she wanted to be a mom, even if that eventually meant doing it on her own, revealing that she had decided to freeze her eggs before falling for her husband, Carter Reum.
“I was like, ‘I don’t need a man. I’m successful. I can support a family. I can do anything,' ” Hilton recalls while speaking in the doc. “I don’t trust anyone, so I’m just going to be a single mom.’ The walls I had built around my heart from so many years of pain and heartbreak that I just never could let anyone in.""
Hilton and Reum had been friends for 15 years before their connection became romantic.

""The moment I let go of all the pain I had been carrying, I made space for real love to find me,"" Hilton says in Infinite Icon while speaking about her relationship with Reum.

Hilton has also said that while she’s open to potentially expanding her family, it’s not necessarily part of her currenct plan.
""Never say never"" she told Extra in a Jan. 1 interview while discussing the idea of welcoming another child.
""I love babies so much. Sometimes I think about it, but they're so perfect, and I love that I have a boy and a girl. So, I don't know,"" she said.

The biggest football game of the year is almost upon us: Super Bowl LX!
On Feb. 8, 2026, the New England Patriots and Seattle Seahawks will tackle it out at Levi's Stadium in Santa Clara, Calif., home of the San Francisco 49ers. The venue opened in 2014 and later hosted Super Bowl 50 in 2016, where the Denver Broncos upset the Carolina Panthers with a final score of 24-10.
A decade later, the massive NFL event has seen several appearances from the Kansas City Chiefs — led by Patrick Mahomes — and New England Patriots, with Tom Brady serving as quarterback during their dominance. However, 2026 will mark the first year without the Chiefs since 2022.
Whether you're all in on the game or you're really into the country's most-watched broadcast for the food (wings and nachos and chips and dips, oh my!), the commercials and memorable ads or the halftime performance (we see you, Bad Bunny!), the match-up between NFC champs Seahawks and the AFC's Patriots is set to be a great one.
Before the festivities and kickoff, revisit the last 10 years of Super Bowl teams and which ones took home the Vince Lombardi Trophy.
A repeat showdown! Just two years after facing one another in Super Bowl LVII in 2023, the Kansas City Chiefs and Philadelphia Eagles were back at it again in New Orleans, though this time with only one Kelce brother, as Jason Kelce retired from the Eagles in 2024 after 13 seasons with the Birds.
With their blowout 40-22 win at Caesars Superdome, home of the New Orleans Saints, the Eagles blocked the Chiefs from a three-peat. The victory marked then-26-year-old quarterback Jalen Hurts' first Super Bowl championship, and he was also named the championship game's MVP after scoring three touchdowns.
Back-to-back, baby! The Chiefs clinched another Super Bowl victory on Feb. 11, 2024, after overtaking the San Francisco 49ers in overtime with a score of 25-22 at Allegiant Stadium in Las Vegas.
Rallying in the second half, the Chiefs became the first team to secure two consecutive championships since the New England Patriots in 2003 and 2004.

On Feb. 12, 2023, the Chiefs beat the Eagles 38-35 in the ""Kelce Bowl"" at State Farm Stadium, home of the Arizona Cardinals. Brothers Jason (then center for the Eagles) and Travis Kelce (tight end for the Chiefs) were the first siblings in NFL history to play against each other in the Super Bowl.
The game came down to the wire, with Chiefs kicker Harrison Butker sealing the win with a clutch field goal, which was set up by a critical defensive holding call on Eagles cornerback James Bradberry.
The Los Angeles Rams won on their home turf, the then recently built SoFi Stadium, in a back-and-forth against the Cincinnati Bengals that ended 23-20.
Trailing behind in the fourth quarter, the Rams reclaimed the lead with less than two minutes left as wide receiver Cooper Kupp — later named Super Bowl MVP — scored the game-winning touchdown.
Brady won his seventh Super Bowl with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who set a franchise record 13–4 season in 2020–2021.
Playing at his new home stadium in Tampa, Fla., Brady led the Bucs to a dominant 31-9 win over the Chiefs. The following year, he retired at age 44, after three seasons in Florida and 20 years in New England.
Mahomes guided the Chiefs to a 31-20 victory over the San Francisco 49ers in Super Bowl LIV in Miami. With under three minutes remaining, the star quarterback orchestrated two touchdowns, earning him the Super Bowl MVP title.
Nearly two decades after locking horns at Super Bowl XXXVI in 2002, the Patriots and Rams met for a rematch during Super Bowl LIII in Atlanta. In the lowest-scoring Super Bowl ever, the Patriots beat the Rams 13-3, marking the franchise's sixth championship.
Super Bowl LII saw the Eagles triumphantly defeat the Patriots 41-33 in Minneapolis, securing the Birds' first Lombardi Trophy in the team's 91-year history.
The long-awaited win sent diehard fans into a frenzy. Some celebrated with pure joy, while others expressed their excitement in chaotic ways throughout the streets of Philly.
The Atlanta Falcons were defeated by the New England Patriots 34-28 in Super Bowl LI in Houston.
Down 28-3 midway through the third quarter, the Patriots pulled off the biggest comeback in Super Bowl history, erasing a 25-point deficit to tie the game in the final seconds of regulation play. This sent the game into the first overtime in Super Bowl history, where the Patriots won the coin toss and scored the winning touchdown.
In Santa Clara, Calif., Cam Newton and the Carolina Panthers were defeated by the Denver Broncos, who took an early lead they never relinquished. With a 24-10 final score, this marked quarterback Peyton Manning's second and last Super Bowl victory before retiring after 18 seasons in the NFL.",who-played-in-(and-won!)-the-last-10-super-bowls?-,"Take a cue from Patrick Mahomes and huddle up to find out the Super Bowl contenders — and champions — of the past decade

With athletes arriving in Milan for the 2026 Winter Olympics and Paralympics, one important question remains: Where do they stay?
While Olympic Villages in Tokyo in 2021 and Paris in 2024 got attention for their sustainable cardboard beds, the 2026 Winter Games drew notice for one of its accommodation options — a temporary mobile home in Cortina. However, that won't be the only Village set-up.
For the first time, there will be six Olympic Villages located around Northern Italy. According to the Associated Press, it's unlikely that notable U.S. athletes Lindsey Vonn and Mikaela Shiffrin will stay at the Cortina trailer park, which is the home base for alpine skiers, as well as bobsled, curling and skeleton competitors.
For the athletes who do choose to stay in one of the Olympic Villages, what will their accommodations look like? Read on to find out.
An Olympic Village is a residential complex where athletes, coaches, staff and officials can stay during the Olympic Games. They provide safe, centralized accommodation for the two weeks and are generally located near the main stadiums or sports centers.
The first athlete accommodations were built for the 1924 Summer Games, and, understandably, many changes have been made to the housing since that era's small wooden huts were constructed.
There won't be a single campus but six Olympic Villages in Northern Italy in 2026. Located in Milan, Livigno, Bormio, Predazzo, Anterselva and Cortina, the villages will be comprised of both new and existing facilities, depending on the location, per the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The IOC has referred to this setup as ""the first edition of the Winter Games with a multi-centered model.""
The Milan Olympic Village, located in the city's Porta Romana district, is one of the new builds. The facility, which can host 1,500 people, will be transformed into permanent student housing when the Olympics conclude.
However, the location getting the most notice is Cortina, where a temporary mobile home village has been set up. The pop-up town can hold 1,400 residents and will include roughly 377 compact wooden-clad homes. Connected by walkways and plazas, each accommodation is the size of a small apartment.
The mobile homes are described as ""simple and spartan"" but have unparalleled views of the mountains, Fabio Saldini, the Italian government commissioner overseeing infrastructure for the games, told the Associated Press.
""The beauty of a Village like this lies in the fact that everything will be removed afterward,"" Saldini said. ""Nothing is permanent; the environment will not return to its previous state but will be improved. This is a temporary village, but of high design.""
Freestyle and snowboard athletes will be housed in Livigno at three traditional Alpine lodges, while Bormio, near the skiing areas, and Anterselva will house athletes in hotels. In Predazzo, an existing structure is being repurposed for athletes and officials.

So, what exactly is the roommate situation in the Olympic Village? Team USA's 2024 Olympic Village Director Daniel Smith told PEOPLE that each sport typically decides who shares a space.
""A lot of times, we'll give them their allocation. So let's say you have 16 athletes on your team ... field hockey. So we'll say, 'Okay, you have four apartments. Each apartment has X number of beds. It's two people to a room,' "" Smith explained of the situation at the Paris Games. ""Then the team leader will come back and say, 'Okay, here's our rooming list. These are who we're going to room with who.' ""
Decorated Olympic gymnast Simone Biles was one of the big names who had a roommate in Paris. She even gave fans an Instagram Stories tour of the room she shared with Jade Carey, her fellow Team USA gymnast.
At the 2022 Beijing Olympics, Team USA ice hockey gold medalist Hilary Knight also gave fans a ""room tour."" Knight's Instagram video featured cameos from her teammates Amanda Kessel and Hannah Brandt in the ""McMansion.""
Fans got a glimpse of the ultra-modern, minimalist suite, which included a living room outfitted with couches and chairs, a TV and a cart serving as a makeshift pantry with easy access to a microwave. There were also multiple bathrooms and bedrooms; the latter were outfitted with an armoire and a decent-sized bed complete with white comforters and small blue blankets with ""Beijing"" written across them.
Smith confirmed to PEOPLE that each team, as well as individual athletes, can choose whether to stay in the Village.
""We have some very high-profile athletes in our delegation,"" Smith said. ""So to avoid any distractions within the Village from other countries' athletes, they decide to stay out.""
In Paris, the U.S. men's basketball team, which included athletes like LeBron James and Stephen Curry, had accommodations outside of the Village, for example. However, some big-name athletes stayed in the Village in Paris, like Coco Gauff, who shared in a 2024 TikTok comment that while ""some of my teammates are in a hotel, I chose to stay in [the] village for the experience.""
Though Vonn may not stay in a Village in Italy, she told PEOPLE in July 2024 about their importance, vowing to do what she can to also help families of athletes in her role as a member of the bid committee, which is bringing the Winter Olympics to Salt Lake City in 2034.
""It's just going to make life so much easier for everyone involved,"" Vonn said. ""I mean, my family, even in Salt Lake 2002, my family had a hard time finding a place to stay. You think of how many people are coming into that city to spectate, where are the families going to go? They can't pay a premium on the big hotels. My family stayed at my second cousin's house in Salt Lake City and slept on the floor.""
It's doable to not stay in the village, but it does make life a little harder for the duration of the Games.
""If a sport decides not to stay in [the village], they have to find their own arrangements in terms of where they're going to stay, and make their own hotel contracts,"" Smith said. ""A challenge with that is that basically you're outside of the bubble at that point.""
In Paris, for example, transportation wasn't provided for hotels outside of the village.
""All of the meals, all of those additional pieces that come along with logistics that athletes in the Village get, you stay out, and all of that is on you,"" Smith added.",which-athletes-stay-in-the-olympic-village?-inside,"Daniel Smith, the 2024 Olympic Village director for Team USA, explained why big-name athletes may opt out of staying at the Olympic Village during the Games

Michael Douglas took on Gordon Gekko in Oliver Stone’s 1987 thriller Wall Street, becoming one of cinema’s most infamous villains and earning an Academy Award in the process.
Known for his charisma, Douglas faced the challenge of mixing charm with ruthlessness, but Stone wanted someone who could embody ambition, greed and moral ambiguity to the fullest.
In a recent interview with TCM’s Alicia Malone, Douglas recalled a moment, just two weeks into filming, when Stone’s feedback truly hit hard.
“Okay, so we were finishing the second week of filming, and there was a knock on my door. ‘Hey Mike, it’s Oliver. Can I come in?’” Douglas, 81, recalled. “I say, ‘Yeah, come on in.’ He comes in the trailer and sits down. He says to me, ‘You okay?’ I said, ‘Yeah, I'm okay.’ ""
""[He asks], ‘Are you doing drugs?’ I said, ‘No, I’m not doing drugs.’ And he said, ‘Because you look like you’ve never acted before in your life,'"" the actor continued at the TCM Classic Film Festival in New York on Jan. 31.

Still, Douglas said that, even though Stone’s critique was harsh, he handled it well. The director pushed him to closely examine his performance, especially in the key scenes that showed Gekko’s manipulative side.
Up until that point, Douglas explained that he never looked at the dailies — the raw, unedited footage shot that day.
“So I said, ‘Well, I don’t like to look at the dailies because I’m one of those guys that always sees what’s wrong or what’s not going to be in the film'… so I don’t pay attention to the dailies,"" Douglas noted. ""So I said, ‘I guess I’d better take a look,’ and he said, ‘Yeah, you better.' ""
So, Douglas went to the editing room and looked at two scenes, one of which was the limo scene alongside Charlie Sheen.
“And I’m looking at them really hard, and critically, and they seemed pretty good. So I keep saying, ‘I think it’s pretty good,’ and [Stone said], 'Yeah, it is, isn’t it,'"" he recalled.

The experience highlighted Stone's willingness to get under Douglas' skin to help him explore the darker edges of Gekko – demanding more “nastiness,” “vengeance” and “meanness” from the character.
“He was willing for me to hate his guts for the rest of this movie to get that extra little push,” Douglas said.
The legendary actor noted that Stone has always found a way to ""push actors"" to give ""their best performance"" — pointing to James Woods in Salvador, Tom Cruise in Born on the Fourth of July, Kevin Costner in JFK, Val Kilmer in The Doors and more.
""His record of successes with actors is quite impressive. So I'm deeply, deeply appreciative of the fact that it gave me part and the fact that he pushed me to another level,"" Douglas ended.
In the end, the dedication paid off, with Wall Street cementing Douglas as a masterful actor and earning him an Academy Award for Best Actor.",michael-douglas-recalls-harsh-note-from-wall-stree,"The 1987 crime-thriller earned Douglas an Academy Award for Best Actor

""They are getting to compete at the absolute highest level on the world stage, and it's just so exciting to see as someone who has deeply appreciated athletics throughout my whole life.""

Kelce is one of approximately 25 content creators across YouTube, Meta and TikTok platforms who will tell stories about the Games in their unique styles, giving viewers on-the-ground access in Milan and Cortina through NBCUniversal's Creator Collective.

She boasts 2.7 million followers on Instagram and 2.6 million followers on TikTok, and her podcast has over 439,000 subscribers on YouTube.
""She reached out to us during Paris because she was a field hockey player, of course, and so we knew she had an interest in Olympic sports,"" Solomon, who oversaw production of the 2024 Summer Games at the time, said of Kelce.

According to Kelce, ""It is mind-blowing to meet these athletes and get to see them compete.""
""It gives you almost a sense of fulfillment through them, that you're getting to see they have really done everything they needed to do to put themselves in these positions,"" she continues. ""And then they get to, as a team, fight for a medal together. It's just this beautiful story.""
Adds Kelce: ""I'm so, so grateful, not only that I'll get the chance to talk to some of the athletes about their story and how they got there, but then also that I'll get to cheer them on while they compete.""

These steep markdowns won't last long
No, it’s not too good to be true: You don’t have to wait until next week to shop Presidents Day sales — at Amazon, that is.
The site is overflowing with early discounts in every department, so I did the heavy lifting to find 100 worth adding to your cart. Shoppers can already save up to 83 percent on Ugg slippers, Apple AirPods, Dyson vacuums, Le Creuset cookware, and so much more, including end-of-season fashion and early spring sales. Act fast to score these coveted markdowns while prices start at $5.
The best early Presidents Day sales I spotted include an $13 Hanes sweatshirt that’s great for layering, a Kate Spade bag marked down by nearly $200, and a multifunctional steam cleaner for a whopping 83 percent off. You can also save on celebrity-approved picks like Oprah’s current “favorite” slippers, which she included in her most recent list of Favorite Things, as well as a Laura Geller mascara that Fran Drescher wore to the Golden Globes last month. 
There’s no shortage of deals in Amazon’s fashion department. Droves of shoppers are going after this best-selling lounge set that one reviewer called their solution to “looking sloppy” (without sacrificing comfort, of course!). 
There’s also an impressive markdown on this V-neck sweater that’s made from a soft and toasty cashmere blend — and it doesn’t come with a hefty price tag. Pair it with leggings or lounge pants for a relaxing day at home, or team it with these straight-leg jeans that look so similar to a pair Jennifer Aniston just wore for a day out. 
You can get a jump on spring refreshes while Amazon’s home deals last. If you’re planning ahead for spring cleaning chores, pick up this popular cordless vacuum that converts to a handheld, as well as this prized Bissell carpet cleaner to banish a year’s worth of grime from upholstery. 
It’ll also be time to swap your thick, flannel sheets for a lighter option soon, and we’re eyeing these cooling bed sheets that over 1,000 shoppers  bought in the last month. You can even snag a set of new bed pillows to more thoroughly upgrade your sleep sanctuary. 
As for cookware and kitchen appliances, top brands like Cuisinart, KitchenAid, and Ninja are already on super sale. For everyday workhorses, pick up this stainless steel stockpot for all of your large-batch meals, as well as this 15-piece knife set that comes with the wooden block and all sorts of blades to streamline prepwork. You can even treat your household to professional-level ice cream right from your own kitchen while the Ninja Creami is on sale; it’s an Oprah-approved device that can whip up your custom flavor combinations.
Presidents Day is an excellent time to save on big-ticket items, like furniture. Luckily, you don’t have to wait while these discounts are going on; we found everything from an $18 shoe rack to an entire loveseat sofa going for less right now. 
If you’re looking to add seating to your home or dress up a corner of a room, try this mid-century modern barrel chair whose “quality is A+,” according to one reviewer. It’s covered in luxe-looking bouclé fabric that adds texture to your living space.
Amazon’s beauty section has early Presidents Day sales on drugstore darlings and more luxurious picks, like a Dyson Airwrap and an Elemis moisturizer. For something more affordable, try this $20 Neutrogena moisturizer that a dermatologist recently told me is a good choice for anyone looking to target fine lines and wrinkles.
There’s also a rare sale on do-it-all haircare from Pureology. This leave-in conditioner spray promises 21 benefits for your hair; it boosts softness and shine, strengthens locks, and serves as a heat protectant before styling (just to name a few!). 
If you’ve lined up any getaways for 2026, then quality travel gear is a must. You can ditch your old, beat-up suitcase for this Samsonite carry-on that has a protective hardshell exterior, or restock your whole luggage collection for this SwissGear three-piece set that comes with different-sized softside bags for your travels. 
Don’t forget about accessories, like compression socks and neck pillows. These nifty packing cubes compress your clothes into your suitcase to help optimize your packing space, while this clever toiletry bag keeps bottles upright and spill-free on the go. 
Even electronics are on sale before Presidents Day weekend. There are tons of discounts on Apple tech, including the AirPods 4 for just $100, as well as the newest AirPods Pro 3 for $19 less. I personally recommend these Marshall over-ear headphones; they have a cool, retro look with impressively modern sound quality. Plus, they’re under $90 today. 
If you’re waiting to score sales next weekend, here’s an appetizer of affordable finds that are under $25. These Ugg socks are a cozy essential that you can slip on every day to close out the winter, or reach for these rechargeable hand warmers that haven’t left my coat pocket since I bought them last month. Or if warm weather is on the brain, pick up this tropical-scented Yankee Candle to transport yourself to a breezy beach instantly.   
PSA: Presidents Day weekend is also Valentine’s Day weekend. If you’re on the hunt for last-minute gift ideas, don’t miss out on these discounts. For something classic, pick up the new Charlotte Tilbury perfume, the campaign of which starred Celine Dion, or try these Ana Luisa hoop earrings that are covered in striking pave crystals. For something a bit more unexpected, try this Lego flower bouquet that serves as an interactive activity, then doubles as décor once it’s built.

The Investigation of Lucy Letby premiered in February 2026 and included unseen bodycam footage from the nurse's arrest as well as interviews from a doctor who claimed prosecutors ""misrepresented"" his research.
""I feel like I have only ever done my best for those babies,"" she said while crying during her initial interview with police.

Letby was found guilty in August 2023 of killing seven infants — five boys and two girls — while they were in her care in the neonatal unit of Chester Hospital in Cheshire, England, between 2015 and 2016. She faced a total of 22 charges related to those deaths as well as the alleged attempted killings of 10 more infants.
During her trial, which began in October 2022, several colleagues testified that they witnessed unusual behavior from the former nurse. She was eventually convicted of 14 of the possible 22 counts and sentenced to life in prison.
Since her sentencing, Letby has unsuccessfully appealed her convictions twice, per The Guardian.

Here's everything to know about Lucy Letby's murder trial and crimes.
Lucy Letby was a neonatal nurse from Chester, a city near Liverpool in the north of England. Letby began working in the neonatal unit at Countess of Chester Hospital in 2011. In a 2013 profile with the Chester Standard, Letby described her job as ""caring for a wide range of babies requiring various levels of support.""
Before January 2015, prosecutor Nick Johnson said, the deaths in Chester Hospital's neonatal unit were statistically comparable to other hospitals. However, during the time Letby was a neonatal nurse, he explained, there was a ""significant rise"" in the number of ""babies who were dying and in the number of serious catastrophic collapses.""
Johnson added that consultants concluded the babies' deaths were ""not medically explicable and were the result of the actions of Lucy Letby.""
Letby was accused of murdering seven infants and attempting to kill 10 more between 2015 and 2016. The seven deaths were believed to have been caused by being given excess milk, air, insulin or fluid. Among the victims were two babies from a set of triplets, Child P and Child O. Child O suffered ""acute deterioration,"" according to the BBC, and Letby allegedly asked a doctor if the baby was ""leaving alive.""
Child H, the third triplet, was given an excess of air and clear liquid, endangering its life. Letby allegedly made two attempts to murder the premature infant, prosecutors said. The baby was removed from the hospital at the insistence of the parents and made a ""rapid recovery,"" according to the BBC.
Some of the children, prosecutors say, survived multiple attacks before dying. ""The collapses of all 17 children concerned were not 'naturally occurring tragedies,' "" Johnson told the jury during Letby's trial. ""They were all the work, we say, of the woman in the dock, who we say was the constant, malevolent presence when things took a turn for the worse for these 17 children.""
Another baby, known as Child G, survived three alleged attacks, her parents testified in court in December. They believe Letby intentionally overfed the infant milk and air, leading to ""irreversible brain damage"" and quadriplegia cerebral palsy.
In one instance described in the testimony, Letby tried to kill an infant, referred to as Child G, while the baby's assigned nurse was on a break. Under Letby's care, expert witness Dr. Dewi Evans testified the baby received ""far more milk"" than prescribed, and that the overfeeding couldn't have been an accident but was an ""intent to harm,"" per the BBC. That baby survived, but seven others did not.
In another instance, when an infant was in distress, Letby ""told off"" a coworker who attempted to assist. ""I was shocked because you can't have enough help in that situation,"" Lisa Walker testified, according to the BBC. ""[I was] quite taken aback and shocked because it's something you would not expect a nurse to say.""

Dr. Ravi Jayaram, a senior doctor at Cheshire Hospital, testified that he raised suspicions about Letby to the hospital administration in 2015 and 2016, but was ignored for months. In one instance, Dr. Jayaram claimed that he observed Letby standing over an infant whose breathing tube was dislodged, watching the baby's oxygen levels dropping and doing nothing. The doctor intervened, but the baby died three days later.
The Cheshire Constabulary launched its own investigation into the deaths in May 2017, after they were alerted to Letby's suspicious behavior. She has since been arrested three times on suspicion of involvement with the deaths: first in 2018 and again in 2019, though she was released both times. She was remanded in custody following her November 2020 arrest.
Letby's trial began in October 2022 at the Manchester Crown Court in England, and she pleaded not guilty to all 22 charges. The prosecution presented handwritten notes found in Letby's home, in which she allegedly described herself as a ""horrible evil person"" and says she ""killed them on purpose."" But other notes purportedly proclaimed her innocence. ""I haven't done anything wrong and they have no evidence so why have I had to hide away?"" the notes read.
""Well, ladies and gentlemen, that in a nutshell is your task in this case,"" prosecutor Johnson told the jury when he presented the evidence in February 2023. ""Whether or not she did these dreadful things is the decision you will have to make when you have heard all the evidence.""
In May 2023, Letby took the stand in her own defense, telling the jury that she meant no harm during her time working at the Countess of Chester Hospital. ""I only ever did my best to care for them,"" Letby said of the babies in her care. ""That's completely against everything that being a nurse is. I am there to care not to harm.""
Later that month, Letby claimed in court that the infant deaths could be related to alleged plumbing issues in the hospital.
""We used to have raw sewage coming out of the sinks [and] coming out on the floor in nursery one,"" she alleged, also claiming that staff being unable to wash their hands could be ""a contributory issue.""
However, when prosecutor Nick Johnson delivered his closing arguments in June 2023, he said that Letby used lethal air injection on at least 12 of her alleged victims. Johnson claimed air injection was ""one of her favorite ways of killing or trying to kill children in this case.""
On Aug. 18, 2023, Letby was found guilty of 15 of the 22 counts she faced following a 10-month trial, according to a statement from the Crown Prosecution Service. At the time, the 11-person jury was undecided on the charged attempted murder of a further four babies, but a verdict on one of the babies, known as Child K, was decided during a retrial in July 2024, where she was handed her 15th life sentence.
“Because the seriousness of your offenses is exceptionally high, I direct that the early release provisions do not apply,"" Judge Justice Goss told the court during her sentencing. ""The order of the court therefore is whole life order on each and every offense and you will spend the rest of your life in prison.""
Prosecutor Johnson described Letby as a ""malevolent presence"" in the hospital, claiming that the killer nurse falsified her notes to ""cover her tracks.""
The prosecution also showed the jury text messages sent from Letby to a friend in which the former nurse wrote she he had a ""mini meltdown"" over what happened at work. The texts were exchanged within weeks of the deaths of three infants.
Jurors were also shown Post-it notes seemingly written by Letby that prosecutors say were found during a search of her home. One note called Letby a ""horrible evil person"" who isn't ""good enough, while another read, ""I haven't done anything wrong and they have no evidence so why have I had to hide away?""
Former coworkers also testified against Letby. On Oct. 24, 2022, one colleague testified that the health of an infant girl, identified only as Child B, began to decline rapidly under Letby's care. Child B's twin brother had already died and when the baby girl became sick, the colleague's first thought was ""not again,"" because there was such an unusually high number of unexplained infant deaths in the unit.
""Babies can be very poorly quickly but there is usually some indication that is happening,"" she testified. ""We had no undue concerns.""
Later in the trial, Letby's supervisor testified that she observed Letby spending an unusual amount of time with a premature baby whom she wasn't assigned to care for. That baby unexpectedly declined in health and died. Her supervisor claimed that Letby spent time with the family of the baby who eventually died rather than her own designated baby. ""I asked Lucy to focus on [her designated baby] because I was still concerned about him,"" testified the supervising nurse, whose name is being protected per British law. ""However, Lucy went into the family room a few times and I asked her to come out and leave that family with [the assigned nurse] instead.""
In the instance of Child E — an infant who weighed less than 3 lbs. and another one of Letby's alleged victims — his mother testified that she found her son in a state of distress, bleeding from the mouth, but Letby dismissed her concerns. ""Trust me, I'm a nurse,"" the killer nurse allegedly said.
Letby also wrote a sympathy card to another set of parents whose child she allegedly killed. ""There are no words to make this time any easier,"" Letby wrote. ""It was a real privilege to care for [child] and get to know you as a family — a family who always put [child] first and did everything possible for her. She will always be part of your lives and we will never forget her. Thinking of you today and always.""
In April 2023, jurors were shown images of Letby's diary, which detail the initials of the babies she's accused of killing.
Prosecutors also shared a document in which some of the babies' names were written, alongside what they say are Letby's words ""kill me"" and ""I don't know if I killed them. Maybe I did. Maybe this is all down to me.""
Letby was convicted of 14 of the possible 22 counts and sentenced to life in prison. The former nurse has unsuccessfully tried to appeal her convictions twice.
According to The Guardian, a coroner formally opened inquests into the deaths of five newborn babies she was convicted of murdering in February 2026.

It was an irresistible headline and about an “insane situation”: a couple who had to fall back in love after the boyfriend lost his memories in an accident.
More than a year after Cody Bryant’s romance with Haley Woloshen first drew national attention — in PEOPLE, on the Today show — he is sharing an update about healing from the brain injury that caused all the commotion as well as where things stand with Woloshen now.
The good news? He’s finally “feeling like I’m me.”
That wasn’t always the case. Far from it.
On Sept. 6, 2022, Bryant was in a horrific moped crash while on a trip with friends to Ibiza, off the coast of Spain. He was left in a five-day coma before his family was able to get him to America for treatment.
“In the early days, they didn’t know if I was even going to live, and if I was going to live, they were not sure I’d make it out of a vegetative state,” Bryant, 37, says now. “So the outlook was very bleak.”
Back home in California, Bryant reconnected with Woloshen while in a rehab facility, though his brain injury caused him to forget their brief but ardent bond.
“I saw all the messages I had sent to Haley and I was like, ‘Whoa, I must have liked this girl,’ ” he previously told PEOPLE

He had: Their whirlwind romance began in Hawaii in August 2022 after they crossed paths at a bar and realized, by chance, that they lived in the same town.
When they returned to the U.S. from their vacations, just as things were heating up, Bryant was injured and appeared to “ghost” Woloshen, 29, who only realized the truth in the days afterward.
The pair began chronicling their unusual love story on social media and then in news articles. Bryant says that they gave it a good go but decided to amicably split in February 2025. They remain friends, he says. (Woloshen declined to be interviewed.)
“As our lives developed, we realized we weren’t super aligned in what we wanted in the future,” Bryant says. “But I’m so appreciative of my time with her and I think she thinks the same as well.”
He has concentrated on getting back physically, mentally and emotionally to where he was before he was struck by a truck while riding a moped in a head-on crash — a possibility that, the last time he spoke with PEOPLE in 2024, didn’t seem even remotely real to him.

But hard work and a good attitude, not to mention new rehabilitation techniques, have paid off for Bryant, he says.
These days, he even goes for cold-water dunks in the ocean near his Hermosa Beach home to stimulate his mind and body.
He chronicles his progress on his TikTok and Cody’s Comeback Instagram account. A few months ago, he climbed Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania with the help of guides. He recently returned from a trip to Puerto Rico and, this month, he’ll travel to Chile to climb in Patagonia.
Bryant says his parents worry about him — thinking about what went wrong in 2022 — so he makes sure he gives them his itinerary and stays in touch. And he accepts more help than he did before his crash.
He also just organized the second annual Cody Bear Volleyball Tournament fundraiser. The first was done by his friends for his own benefit, but he decided to pay it forward on Dec. 6 by raising money for another local man, Matthew Cobley II, who suffered a traumatic brain injury in 2022 when he was hit on his bicycle by a motorist.
Cobley has a donation page to help with his ongoing medical costs.
“Recovering from traumatic brain injury is a huge financial cost, and insurance doesn’t pay much beyond the acute stage,” Bryant says.
He realized that his own recovery has been “incredible and blown away expectations,” and he wants to give hope to others with brain injuries because “health care did not give me much hope.”
“Health care did an incredible job of saving my life, and I’m so grateful for that, but past the acute care there’s a huge gap,” he says. “What do you do afterward? How do you get your life back now that you’re alive?”
He says he wishes he knew a couple of years ago what he has learned about that post-acute phase. ""My recovery would’ve happened so much better and easier,” he says. “It still would stink and be difficult, but I could expedite and improve it with the knowledge I have now.”

“Now that I’ve started coming out of it and into a normal life, I’m like — what do I do now? I have a new life in front of me,” he says. “So it’s like endless opportunities, but also you can get overwhelmed.”
Putting on the charity event in December was “one of the best days of my life,” and he is now working with a stroke survivor to create mentorship and support systems for brain injury survivors transitioning from acute care to independent life, he says.
He's been dating a bit, too, and pondering the future.
“Prior to my accident, any job was mainly a way to make money, but now I feel like I have a purpose,” he says. “I’ve gone through something that gives me a way to help other people.”
Despite his newfound caution, in the wake of his injury, he still has an adventurer’s soul and a readiness to see the world. He says his mom used to tell him, “Cody, stop living life like you're invincible.”
“I joked with her after the accident, although she did not find this funny, and said — 'Well, mom, I kind of proved that I am.' ”","tourist-lost-memories-after-accident,-then-fell-in","Cody Bryant has been through a lot in the last few years, but he's on the road to recovery — and helping others

A man kept putting his young son in mismatched shoes. When he finally noticed his error, it led to a life-changing realization about his own health.
Andy Johnson was getting his son Oaklen dressed for nursery school like any other day, when his wife, Danni Johnson, realized he had selected two different styles of shoes in “completely different colors,” he told the BBC.
Andy, 35, already knew he had a vision problem. He had been diagnosed with a genetic condition known as retinal dystrophy as a child, which caused him to have tunnel vision, but his central vision had always been fine and remained stable for most of his life.
But after the style incident with his son, Andy determined that his eyesight seemed to be deteriorating, so he went to the doctor. However, he told the BBC he received little support for his concerns.

""[We] sat in the waiting room, and we got called in, and I just said, 'I can't see out of my right eye anymore,' and in a way they were a bit like, 'Oh, you knew this was going to happen anyway.’ It was a bit blunt,” Andy recalled.
""When you leave the hospital, you're on your own, and that's the scary thing, and that's what I want to change,"" Danni, 31, added. “All these questions go through your head — the kids getting married, will [Andy] see that ... but you can't think about it too much as you will spiral.”
Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.
Andy, who co-owns a water sports company with Danni, said he went from feeling confident and capable to essentially becoming a recluse. 
""When my eyesight started to deteriorate, I stopped doing things. I wouldn't cross a road, I wouldn't take the kids to school,” he told the BBC.
Andy and Danni added to the outlet that the sudden shift affected their family dynamic, especially with their eldest son, Finley, 9, who was used to having an active dad who would drive boats and take him to school.
""They've actually said it's a form of trauma,"" Danni explained.
Over time — and with Danni’s urging — Andy began to reengage with life outside their home. They shifted their responsibilities at work so Andy could do more of the managerial side of things while Danni took on more hands-on teaching in the water.
Andy additionally started learning to use a cane, and he eventually got a guide dog named Pearlie.
""Being completely and brutally honest, something had to change, as it was going to ruin our marriage,” Danni told the BBC.

Now, Andy and Danni said they have started to adjust to their new reality. Still, they also acknowledged that life is a lot harder when dealing with a visual disability.
""We are a normal family, but we do have to pedal a lot harder than everyone else to achieve the same,"" Danni said. 
""People don't realize how lucky they are just to go and do the school run and then pop to the shop,"" Andy added.
The father also said there are many parts of his old life that he misses.
""The biggest thing for me has always been my driving: I love cars and my freedom. I'd love to be able to go and do whatever I wanted ... with work, especially,"" Andy told the BBC. ""I would love to still be teaching water sports and just do things without worrying.""
The couple — who post day-in-the-life videos on Instagram to raise awareness about the realities of living with vision loss — told the BBC they now use Andy’s condition as a reminder to live in the moment.
""It sounds so cheesy, but it's taught me the true meaning of life and what we're all here for,"" said Danni, as Andy added, ""We just try and make the most of every moment: 'Let's go to the beach after school. Let's just make time for it.' ""","man,-35,-kept-putting-his-son-in-mismatched-shoes.","Andy Johnson and his family have since drastically altered their lives to accommodate his new limitations

Dylan Efron recently opened up about the start of his relationship with high school sweetheart and longtime girlfriend, Courtney King.
On the Feb. 4 episode of the Teen Beat podcast, the 34-year-old, who competed on season 34 of Dancing with the Stars, revealed how he asked King out nearly 10 years ago.
“It happened super organically, but I remember, like, we both remember locking eyes in the math hall,” Efron told host Danielle Fishel. “That was like the first time we saw each other.”
Efron explained that although King already knew who he was at school, that hallway moment marked their first real connection.
“She says she knew who I was and, like, I was the older kid. So she always knew who I was, but that was the first time that we locked eyes and were like, ‘hey,’” he recalled.
Soon after, Efron reached out to King on Myspace and suggested a tennis date — one that didn’t go exactly as planned.
“We played tennis, and she didn't know me. I'm pretty quirky, again, once you get to know me,” he said, admitting that he left in the middle of their date to grab a drink without asking if she wanted one.
“I was like, 'Oh, I'm thirsty. I'm gonna go with Jamba Juice.' And then I left,” he remembered, leaving King to think the date had been a disaster.
“She was like, 'Oh, that went awful,'” Efron said, laughing at the memory. “But, like, I thought the date went great. So I had no idea.”
Despite the awkward start, the couple recovered and began building a relationship that has lasted for years.
The Traitors star, who is Zac Efron’s younger brother, has pursued a career in Hollywood, while King has chosen to maintain a lower profile. The pair have been dating since at least 2016 and have a shared passion for travel and adventure.
When it comes to marriage, Dylan says he and King are taking things one step at a time.
During a March 2025 appearance on The Viall Files, he shared that ""she knows the answer"" about whether marriage is in their future and made it clear that they are “working on it.”
“Courtney's so down to earth,” he told hosts Natalie Joy and Nick Viall. “She's not going to put a deadline on me.""
Dylan also shared he’s excited for what’s next. “I am now in that stage, I am looking at that next chapter. I want kids,” he said, inspired by his little brother and sister and hoping to start a family of his own someday.",dylan-efron-says-girlfriend-courtney-king-thought-,"Efron and King have managed to keep their decade-long relationship largely out of the spotlight

Lil Jon's late son, Nathan Smith, spoke highly of the rapper in an interview just months before his death.
Since Smith, 27, was found dead on Friday, Feb. 6, a clip from an interview he did with the nonprofit organization 360 Baseline back in March 2025, has resurfaced on Instagram. He praised Lil Jon for “always showing up” as his father throughout the years while discussing their close relationship. 
When asked how having his dad “active” in his life had impacted him, Smith responded, “I mean, to be honest, my dad was the type who never made me, or put me in a place where I had to think about any of that, because he was always there.”
“He was always showing up for my birthdays, even if he had to perform somewhere, he would turn it down and come be with me...,” Smith continued. “Just having him and just him letting me know he's there, whether it was music [or] watching a movie at the end of the day … you don't really have to worry too much about that.”
Smith is Lil Jon’s first child, shared with his estranged wife Nicole Smith. The rapper announced their split in February 2024.
The Milton Police Department revealed that Smith was missing on Feb. 3, after he was seen leaving his home without his phone in Milton, Ga. On Friday, Feb. 6, the police announced that a body, believed to be that of Smith’s, had been recovered from a pond “in Mayfield Park near Smith’s Milton residence.” 
""On Feb. 6, at approximately 11:53 a.m., divers with the Cherokee County Fire Department located and recovered a body from the pond,” the MPD said on Facebook. “The individual is believed to be Nathan Smith, pending official confirmation by the Fulton County Medical Examiner’s Office.""
There was “no indication of foul play,” surrounding the death, the police confirmed.

Lil Jonn said in a statement to PEOPLE following the announcement of his son’s death, he was “heartbroken” at the tragic news. 
""I am extremely heartbroken for the tragic loss of our son, Nathan Smith. His mother [Nicole] and I are devastated,” said the rapper. “Nathan was the kindest human being you would ever meet. He was immensely caring, thoughtful, polite, passionate, and warmhearted - he loved his family and the friends in his life to the fullest.”
Smith was following the footsteps of his dad, as a music producer and artist and was a graduate of New York University.

They may sing “American Idiot,” but the members of Green Day have proven that their music is nothing short of brilliant.
The American punk-rock trio featuring Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt and Tré Cool was formed in 1986 in East Bay, Calif., and went on to become one of the most influential rock bands of their generation.
From the breakout success of their first major studio album, Dookie, in 1994, to the politically charged American Idiot in 2004, Green Day has won four Grammy Awards and earned 19 nominations over the past four decades.
The band’s catalog includes iconic hits like “Basket Case,” “When I Come Around,” “Boulevard of Broken Dreams” and “Wake Me Up When September Ends.” Their impact has also extended beyond the charts and into the theater with the Tony Award-winning American Idiot: The Musical, which premiered in 2009.
Along the way, Green Day has celebrated major milestones. In May 2025, they were honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, a moment that Armstrong described to PEOPLE as feeling “like a fever dream” while Dirnt called it “very emotional” and a tribute not just to the band but to the fans who’ve supported them.
Today, Green Day continues to make music and perform. They released their most recent album, Saviors, in January 2024 and won an iHeartRadio Landmark Award for it. Most recently, in January 2026, they were announced as the openers of the 2026 Super Bowl.
“I still try to maintain that kind of [punk] spirit about what we do,” Armstrong told PEOPLE in January 2024. “Just being independent and free to express yourself the way that you want.”
Here’s a look into where the members of Green Day are now.
Billie Joe Armstrong and Green Day; Paul Bergen/Redferns
Green Day lead vocalist and guitarist Armstrong was born on Feb. 17, 1972, in Oakland, Calif. His father, Andrew Armstrong, died when Armstrong was 10. It was a devastating loss for the singer, and he later opened up about it in their song “Wake Me Up When September Ends.”
Armstrong met Dirnt in school the same year, and they formed a band called Sweet Children in their teens, which later became Green Day. They were joined by Tré Cool in 1990, solidifying the lineup that would take punk rock from local Bay Area clubs to international stadiums.
As a rising indie band with local success, Armstrong admitted they were “freaked out” to release their first studio album, Dookie. “You never know what is going to happen as far as what the public is going to think — and even our own fan base at that time was going to think,” he told PEOPLE in February 2024. “Because a lot of it was the controversy of us going from an indie to a major label.”
“It was also very exciting at the same time,” he continued. “All of a sudden, we're playing Lollapalooza and Woodstock, and our shows were getting bigger. We were on MTV. That was a lot of fun. But it was a double-edged sword, a little bit.”
The album saw massive success, even earning the band their first Grammy Award in 1994 for Best Alternative Music Performance.
Outside of Green Day, Armstrong has worked on side projects like the rock bands Foxboro Hot Tubs and The Longshot.
Armstrong married his longtime partner Adrienne Armstrong in 1994, and they became parents when they welcomed sons Joey and Jakob in 1995 and 1998, respectively. Both are now adults and have performed alongside their dad.
Armstrong has been open about personal struggles over the years, including entering rehab in 2012 and getting sober.
“For me, alcohol gets in the way of everything, from my relationship with my family to just trying to get a good night’s sleep. It gets in the way of my happiness,"" he told PEOPLE in January 2024. ""So that's why I wanted to quit, and I was done.”

Green Day bassist Dirnt was born Michael Ryan Pritchard on May 4, 1972, in California. After a difficult start to life, Dirnt found stability in his friendship with Armstrong, whom he moved in with.
“We were 10 years old, first time I met [Billie],” Dirnt told Consequence of Sound in December 2024. “One of the first conversations we ever had was about songwriting.""
He continued, ""We were just pointed into something that we thought was cool, ’cause at the time we were each struggling to mitigate our own home lives and things like that.""
Dirnt has performed in side projects such as The Frustrators and played with bands, including Screeching Weasel and Armstrong’s Foxboro Hot Tubs.
Outside of his music career, Dirnt has worked on business ventures that reflect his punk roots, including co-owning Rudy’s Can’t Fail Café, a diner in the Oakland–Emeryville area named after a Clash song, and founding Punk Bunny, a coffee company, with his bandmates.
Dirnt is also a dad to three kids: Estelle, Brixton and Ryan.
The bassist told Ticketcorner in October 2017 that he was at his “happiest“ point. “I have a great family, and my band is still firing on all cylinders,” he said, adding that his kids “kept [him] young” while making him “mature earlier.”
In January 2026, Dirnt was given the Lifetime Achievement Award at the Bass Magazine Awards, which was presented by Blink 182 bassist Mark Hoppus.
“I wouldn’t even be standing here right now if it [weren’t] for Billie and Tré, and we don’t say things like this to each other very often or ever, but ... I’m gonna say it to them,” he said in his speech at the event. “Thank you for trusting me to do my part correctly for the songs that we create. I love you guys.”

Green Day drummer Tré Cool was born Frank Edwin Wright III on Dec. 9, 1972, in Frankfurt, West Germany, to American parents. When his family returned to the United States after his father’s service in the military, they settled in California.
Tré Cool joined Green Day in 1990, replacing original drummer John Kiffmeyer and completing the lineup with Armstrong and Dirnt that would go on to mainstream success.
“We were on tour in our yellow Ford Econoline that we called The Toot. We were playing punk clubs, squats, backyard parties. We were screen printing t-shirts on Billie Joe's guitar case and hanging them in people's backyards. Sleeping on floors, couches, wherever we could,” Tré Cool said of their early days as a band. “I didn't think back then that we'd be here now.”
The trio was inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 2015 — their first year of eligibility — and Tré Cool gave a touching speech at the special milestone event.
“Music is the force that gets us up in the morning. It's also the s--- that keeps us up all night,” he said. “It's overwhelming the amount of talent and love in the room. ... Being inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame is an enormous honor.”
Tré Cool is also a father, previously posting about his daughter Ramona and son Mickey.",where-are-the-green-day-members-now?-inside-their-,"Billie Joe Armstrong, Mike Dirnt and Tré Cool have come a long way since starting Green Day in 1986

A woman was diagnosed with a rare condition that causes her breasts to grow rapidly — and she learned she suffered from the health ordeal thanks to a popular GLP-1 drug.
Tianna Moon of East Anglia, a region in eastern England, received her gigantomastia diagnosis in July, according to SWNS.
The 30-year-old, who has had larger-than-average breasts since puberty, first realized something was abnormal with her chest after she began using Mounjaro in 2024. (Mounjaro is an FDA-approved prescription medication for people with type 2 diabetes. It's a brand name for tirzepatide — also known as Zepbound — which is highly effective for weight loss by reducing appetite, increasing feelings of fullness and improving how the body breaks down sugar and fat.)
Losing weight while her breasts continued to grow, Moon's doctor eventually diagnosed her with gigantomastia, which causes breast tissue to grow rapidly and in excess, per the Cleveland Clinic.
Moon said her doctor ""originally"" considered she could be dealing with macromastia, a less severe but similar condition.
""But when I broke down medical history, the weight loss on Mounjaro and the increased growth and side effects, he was point-blank like, 'This is gigantomastia,’ "" she recalled.
The condition can be caused by a variety of factors, including hormonal changes, genetics and autoimmune disorders, according to the Cleveland Clinic.
There are currently only about 300 reported cases of gigantomastia worldwide, the organization said.
Moon said her breasts currently weigh about 39 lbs. — which is approximately 20% of her overall body weight.
And while she admitted her large breasts are “normal” at this point in her life, Moon said the rare condition still comes with challenges.
“The side effects are having numb arms quite a lot and having quite severe indentations on my shoulders,” she said.
Moon added, ""I have some light scarring under my breasts where bras have rubbed and ripped the skin open.”

“Also laying on my back is not something I can do for a long period of time, as it restricts the amount of airflow I can get in,” Moon continued.
When she goes out in public, Moon explained, ""I try and make [my breasts] smaller than they are and strap them up. I [still] get stares and double takes.""
Moon has considered breast reduction surgery, but she said there’s “no guarantee"" her breast tissue won’t grow back at the same rate.
“People are telling me it’s disgusting I’m not having a reduction, and that I’m basically begging for attention,” she said.

Moon has since established an OnlyFans account, opting to use her body challenge for financial gain.
“I might as well try and reap the benefits of my medical condition rather than the negatives,"" she said.
Moon added that her decision to create the account has helped her better appreciate her unique body type.",woman’s-39-lb.-breasts-won’t-stop-growing-due-to-a,"Tianna Moon, 30, realized something was wrong when she lost weight but her breasts continued to increase in size

Evrosina Awad-Parent knew she wanted to feel like herself on her wedding day.
While planning the perfect look, the 23-year-old was struck by how many brides decide to forgo their glasses for the big day — but she chose to go against the grain.
“I was inspired to wear my glasses because I've always worn them since I was 10 years old,"" she tells PEOPLE. ""My main priority when planning my wedding look was to be comfortable, and part of that meant being myself. I'm not myself without my glasses.""
“For over a decade, I have woken up and put them first; it would've been strange not to do that on my wedding day,"" she adds. ""It felt great to feel like I could be authentically myself and still feel as beautiful as I have ever felt.""
The Boston resident decided to share a video of herself getting ready on TikTok, captioned, “When you get married, everyone will tell you not to wear your glasses ... It’s very important you don’t listen.” 
The video went viral, amassing over 1.4 million views, but Awad-Parent admits there were some “mixed reactions.""
“Some people were concerned about photos or makeup, but others were really supportive because they knew this was very much me,” she shares. 
“I hadn't seen many brides with glasses, so I thought it would be a fun little trend that only a few people would see, but it blew up,"" she continues. ""Seeing all the brides in the comments who said they were going to wear glasses or had dropped their photos in the comments was insane!""
While the majority of comments were positive, she says a few people told her that the glasses ruined the look, but for her, they did the opposite.
“At the end of the day, it's my look, each bride should be who they are and do what feels like them,” she says. 
Her advice to other brides is to “do what feels right to you.”
“I felt like myself on my wedding day, and looking back on my pictures, I see the true me.
