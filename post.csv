As the head of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Homan has been instrumental in enforcing the administration's 'zero tolerance' policy on illegal border crossings.</p> <ul><li>Apart from his role at ICE, Homan has also been involved in several high-profile deportation efforts</li></ul> <p>So, what could be driving this sudden change of pace?

However, some see this as an opportunity to engage with Homan and challenge his views.</p> <h2>A Shift in Tone?</h2><p>As Trump's border chief, Homan has been at the forefront of enforcing the administration's hardline stance on immigration. His appointment to lead the effort in Minneapolis could signal a desire to shift tone or tack towards a more moderate approach. 'This is an opportunity for Tom Homan to show that he's willing to listen and work with people,' says Professor Peter Brownell, an expert on immigration policy at the University of Minnesota.</p> <p>While it's unclear what this new direction will ultimately mean for Minneapolis or the nation as a whole, one thing is certain: the arrival of Tom Homan in the city will spark heated debate and scrutiny.

There are warnings of queues at passport control at airports in Europe over upcoming holiday periods, as the rollout of a new biometric border system continues.

Passengers have already reported hours-long waits at some destinations, at busy times, due to the new systems.

A group representing airports said there was a risk of five-to-six-hour queues over the summer.

However, the European Commission said it would be possible to suspend the new system at peak times until September.

Videos posted on social media in the past week describe three-hour queues at Geneva airport's passport control.

Geneva always gets busy during winter as skiers, Brits among them, head for the slopes. 

But the airport is blaming the new Entry-Exit System (EES) at border control for ""congestion... particularly on Saturdays during the busy ski season"".

A spokesperson said implementing EES had been a ""major challenge for Swiss customs and Geneva Airport"".

The spokesman said measures to try and make the process smoother included putting on more staff.

Tenerife remains a popular winter sun destination for Brits

Long waits have been reported at Tenerife, in the Canary Islands, too.

Andrew Knight runs Salasti car hire at Tenerife airport. Most of his customers are from the UK. Many of those arriving for winter sunshine have got stuck in long lines of passengers trying to get through the border kiosks.  

Those who have arrived at quieter times have progressed through passport control quickly, but

 

when when multiple aircraft have landed in short succession, queues have built up.

Some passengers have been getting through passport control ""in about 20 minutes, other people are experiencing one and a half, two-hour delays waiting to use the systems. A few times the systems have gone down, so it's really hit and miss.""

EES kiosks will collect biometric information from non-EU travellers entering the Schengen area

The digital Entry Exit System will eventually replace ink stamps on passports.

It requires non-EU citizens to register fingerprints and a photo alongside having their passport scanned the first time they cross a border of the Schengen free-movement zone. This registration lasts three years.

Air travellers do it upon arrival at European airports, usually with an automated machine or kiosk. The details are verified on future entries. 

The system is part-way through a gradual introduction period which began in October.

At the moment, half of border points are meant to be operating EES, with at least a third of non-EU passengers using it.

Julia Lo Bue-Said, who runs travel agent network Advantage Partnership, said ""without question, the new system has created even more bottlenecks and pinch points [in places] that were already challenged."" 

Border process takes longer

Olivier Jankovec is director general of Airports Council International Europe, which represents more than 600 airports.  

He told the BBC the passenger processing time at border control had increased by ""four to five times"" under EES, with people typically waiting up to two hours.  

Jankovec said problems included not enough border staff, and some machines not working. 

He fears the situation will worsen when large numbers of holidaymakers register over Easter and summer.

Markus Lammert, European Commission Spokesperson for Internal Affairs, says 23m entries and exits have already been registered under EES, and there have been 12,000 refusals of entry.

He insisted the system has operated ""largely without issues"", but said member states would continue to work on improvements.

From 10 April, EES is meant to be in use at every border point, for every eligible passenger.

However, countries can partially suspend EES operations where necessary over the summer, until September.

Jankovec said this would be necessary to cope if ""the situation becomes unsustainable at border control"".

Without it, and if issues around the equipment and border guard numbers didn't improve, he warned of five-to-six-hour waiting times.

The group said close coordination was needed with border control authorities to make sure they could suspend the system ""in a timely manner"".

On Thursday, travel association ABTA said border authorities were under-using their ability to reduce checks when necessary, and said this had led to passengers being ""caught up in lengthy delays"".

ABTA said that as well applying the contingency measures, destinations and border authorities need to do more to plan for peak travel periods. 

Julia Lo Bue-Said advised people to come prepared for long waits over the February half term and beyond.

""Plan for the worst"", she advises, especially at peak times. ""Make sure you've got some refreshments, make sure you've got something to keep [small children] occupied"".

Demonstrators participate in a protest at a Target store to pressure the company to do more to protect employees and community members from ongoing immigration enforcement, in West St. Paul, Minnesota, U.S., January 19, 2026.

Target and other major Minnesota businesses are facing rising discontent from staff, as workers fear the Trump administration's immigration crackdown puts them at risk on the job.

Employees are pushing firms to provide clearer guidance about how to respond if Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officers arrive at their worksites - and asking them to do more to limit agents' access to stores and parking lots.

The pressures have been particularly acute at Target, a national name and one of the state's flagship employers, after the detention of two workers inside one of its suburban Minneapolis stores last month.

In the aftermath, more than 300 staff signed an internal letter, seen by the BBC, urging executives to speak up, and take steps to keep ICE officers off Target properties.

Target cashier Sandra Macmillan, 71, said she resigned last month after seeing the videos, which showed masked agents pinning the two employees to the ground in the store's entryway before pushing them into a vehicle, while one shouted: ""I'm literally a US citizen"".

""I looked online and saw no response from Target,"" said Macmillan, who had worked for the company in Texas since 2021, calling it ""the last straw"". ""There was no acknowledgement whatsoever.""

Sandra Macmillan

Sandra Macmillan, 71, had worked as a cashier at a Target store in Texas since 2021. 

Experts said to what extent firms can restrict access to their properties was a murky legal area.

Target said it had shared resources related to personal safety and ICE protocols with in-store and corporate teams.

Michael Fiddelke, Target's new chief executive who officially took the helm of the retailer this week, told staff in a video message in late January that ""the violence and loss of life in our community is incredibly painful"".

""We are doing everything we can to manage what's in our control, always keeping the safety of our team and guests our top priority,"" he said in the video, a transcript of which was reviewed by the BBC.

Still, the company has not publicly responded to the in-store ICE arrests in January, and did not comment on that incident to the BBC.

The tensions at businesses are part of the fallout as US President Donald Trump moves to deliver on his promises of stricter immigration enforcement, a focal point of his winning 2024 election campaign. 

He has sent thousands of ICE agents to Minneapolis in recent weeks in an initiative dubbed ""Operation Metro Surge"", which officials say is aimed at restoring public safety by arresting and deporting undocumented immigrants with criminal records.

The administration's tactics have prompted thousands nationwide to take to the streets in protest. Federal agents shot and killed two US citizens in Minneapolis last month, and migrants with clean records and US citizens have been caught up in the crackdown.

Workplaces have emerged as a key battleground, as officers use them to make detentions.

Anti-ICE activists have responded with protests aimed at businesses, including Target, Home Depot, DR Horton and the Hilton hotel chain. But instances of firms denying service to ICE agents have also drawn swift backlash from the Trump administration.

After a Hilton franchisee near Minneapolis declined to rent rooms to ICE agents, the Department of Homeland Security blasted the firm on social media for impeding law enforcement.

Hilton later cut ties with that franchise. It then temporarily closed other locations in the city, citing security risks.

On Wednesday, the White House said it would start withdrawing some of its ICE agents from Minneapolis, but said that officers have a responsibility to enforce the law.

In the meantime, concerns about safety have pitted employees against bosses.

Late last month, executives at more than 60 Minnesota-based firms, including Target, signed a letter urging ""an immediate deescalation of tensions"".

But the statement did not mention ICE by name - and did little to quell frustration among employees looking for a stronger pushback.

A Home Depot spokesperson told the BBC that the home improvement retailer ""cannot legally interfere with federal enforcement agencies, including preventing them from coming into our stores and parking lots"".

Home Depot and Target said they did not coordinate with ICE. DR Horton and Hilton did not respond to requests for comment. 

'A line too far'

ICE Out Now Coalition

Unidos Minnesota, a nonprofit group that advocates for immigrant rights, helped organise a rally outside Target's Minneapolis headquarters on February 2.

The muted response from Target, which is headquartered in Minneapolis and has long been a corporate leader in the state, has drawn particular scrutiny.

It has added to the challenges at the firm, which has struggled to navigate political controversies related to its diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) practices and LGBTQ merchandise.

""Target is Minnesota's leading corporate citizen,"" said Ulla Nilsen, an organiser with the immigrant rights non-profit Unidos Minnesota, which helped organise a rally outside Target's Minneapolis headquarters on Monday.

""As a corporate citizen, are you going to stay silent and allow our democracy to be completely destroyed?""

Five people who worked at Target last month, most of whom spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity for fear of retaliation, described growing frustration among staff sparked by the ICE response.

One Minnesota-based corporate employee in the marketing division told the BBC he handed in his two-week notice in mid-January, calling Target's handling of the issue ""a line too far"".

Another staffer, who works at a store in Milwaukee, Wisconsin located in a predominantly Hispanic neighbourhood, said he had not received guidance on what to do if ICE were to be deployed to the area, calling the lack of clarity ""discouraging"".

But he said he was sceptical of demands that the firm challenge the ICE crackdown more directly.

""With the current administration right now, it seems like ICE kind of has a free-for-all to do whatever they want. And I don't exactly see how Target is going to go against that,"" he said.

How much can employers do?

At one restaurant, run by a prominent Minneapolis restaurant group, frustration about how executives were handling the issue prompted staff to go on strike for three days in late January, according to Hazel, an employee who asked to be referred to by only her first name.

Last week, the two sides reached an agreement on how to handle ICE, which included posting signs explicitly denying agents access to private areas of the restaurants without a judicial warrant.

But legal experts said companies are in a tough spot when it comes to limiting access.

Access to non-public areas like employee break rooms requires a signed judicial warrant.

But the rules governing ""quasi-public"" spaces are less clear, which means that in many cases, it is up to employers to make their own assessments, said Jessie Hahn, an attorney at the National Immigration Law Center.

""It's very difficult for employers, because they want to make sure they're addressing their employees' concerns, but also operating within the parameters of the law,"" Shanon Stevenson, a partner at law firm Fisher Phillips, said.

Activists and worker groups say firms should do more.

Rena Wong, president of the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 663 in Minnesota, said some union members have expressed alarm after workers were seized in parking lots where they work. The union represents grocery store employees at several large chains.

Even workers that are US citizens say they are concerned about being detained because of their race, Wong said. In September, the Supreme Court ruled that it is legal for immigration agents to use race as a factor when deciding who to question about immigration status.

Wong said some chains had adopted policies to limit cooperation with ICE on private property in response. But she added: ""The call from employers needs to be stronger, because they are being impacted too, economically.""

The Centro de Trabajadores Unidos en Lucha, a Twin Cities worker centre, is campaigning for DR Horton, America's largest home builder, and other large housing developers to speak up.

""These are some of the biggest economic players in the state and nationwide,"" said executive director Merle Payne, who said ICE agents had visited a DR Horton site in Shakopee, Minnesota at least three times this year.

""They have the power and influence to stand up and demand an end to the raids.""

Nike is under investigation by the US government over claims the footwear giant discriminated against white workers. 

The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), which enforces workplace discrimination laws, announced on Wednesday it has demanded company records going back to 2018, including the use of race and ethnicity data, and whether such information influenced executive pay.

Court documents show it is examining claims the firm engaged ""in a pattern or practice of disparate treatment against white employees, applicants, and training program participants"".

Nike said it was ""committed to fair and lawful employment practices"", calling the inquiry ""a surprising and unusual escalation"".

In a statement, the company said it followed all laws against discrimination.

""We believe our programs and practices are consistent with those obligations and take these matters seriously. We will continue our attempt to cooperate with the EEOC and will respond to the petition.""

The decision to go to battle with Nike, a high-profile consumer brand, is one of the first major actions the EEOC has taken under US President Donald Trump, who has attacked diversity initiatives, saying they amount to ""reverse discrimination"".

The EEOC said its investigation was sparked by a 2024 complaint from America First Legal, a partisan organisation founded by Trump adviser Stephen Miller that identifies ""dismantling diversity, equity and inclusion"" or DEI as a top priority.

In its subpoena request, the EEOC said Nike had failed to fully respond to requests seeking information  about the firm's hiring, training and promotion practices, as well as hiring goals for racial and ethnic minorities.

Those requests started 13 months ago and included a prior subpoena, according to the court filing.

""Nike's failure to comply ... has delayed and hampered the EEOC's investigation of alleged unlawful employment practices,"" court documents stated.

New US rules say countries with diversity policies are infringing human rights

Nike pledges to cut reliance on Chinese factories

Trump puts all US government diversity staff on paid leave 'immediately'

Nike said it had already submitted thousands of pages of information to the EEOC in response to its inquiries.

It has argued the investigation should be dropped because the company is being questioned about diversity policies that the federal agency previously supported.

The EEOC was created as part of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.

But the White House has sought to redirect the commission away from its historic focus on bias affecting minority groups and women.

Andrea Lucas, the chair of the EEOC, has previously said many standard workplace programmes may potentially violate US laws and invited white men to come forward with complaints.

The agency is seeking extensive information as part of the Nike subpoena, including personal information of ""all employees considered or evaluated for potential layoff"" during the company's 2024 job cuts, according to the court filing.

The EEOC is engaged in a similar battle with Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance, which said, in its response, the commission had failed to identify clearly what the firm was doing wrong.

Michael Foreman, director of the Civil Rights Appellate Clinic at Penn State Dickinson Law, called the Nike inquiry ""more of EEOC's consistent pattern of basically being the bully pulpit for the Trump administration"", in an attempt to discourage strong diversity efforts.

""What about discrimination based upon minority status? Based upon national origin?

""These other types of discrimination that are so prevalent are going unaddressed by this agency,"" he added.

Interest rates are expected to remain on hold as the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meets for the first time this year.

The MPC cut the Bank rate from 4% to 3.75% in December, and suggested rates were 

""likely to continue on a gradual downward path""

.

The Bank rate is the primary tool for the committee to try to keep inflation - which charts the annual rate of rising prices - as close to 2% as possible.

It heavily influences the interest charged by lenders for loans and mortgages, and what banks and building societies give in returns to savers.

The majority of analysts are predicting the MPC keeps the Bank rate on hold at 3.75% when it announces its latest decision at 12:00 GMT on Thursday.

Inflation remains above target at 3.4%, according to the latest data for the year to December.

The nine-member committee only narrowly voted for a cut in December and gave a fairly cautious view of the situation.

Analysts say there has been little data so far this year to change the balance between persistent inflation and weak economic growth.

There is also an expectation that the Bank will be vague about when or by how much it will cut the Bank rate during the year as it awaits a clearer picture on inflation.

Some analysts are suggesting one rate cut during 2026, while others believe the MPC could decide on two cuts.

How rates affect your finances

Around a third of households have a mortgage. Of those, about one million have tracker or variable mortgages that tend to change when the Bank rate changes.

The vast majority of mortgage customers have fixed-rate deals. While their monthly payments are not immediately affected by a rate change, future deals can be.

Fixed mortgage rates, for those renewing or signing up to a new deal, fell at the start of the year as lenders competed for customers.

However, broader pressures faced by lenders have shown signs of going up, with commentators saying that could stall any further cuts.

The Bank rate cut in December and conditions thereafter have led to cuts in the interest paid by savings account providers to their customers.

Rachel Springall, from financial information service Moneyfacts, said: ""The slaughter of savings rates will sadden hard-pressed savers. Since the start of this year, more than two-thirds (70%) of savings providers have cut their rates. 

""As inflation remains well above target, real returns on cash savings are weak and this can lead to a dangerous attitude of apathy.""

The MPC has eight meetings a year and, after the latest meeting, it will also publish its quarterly Monetary Policy Report, which sets out its economic analysis and projections on which it bases its decision.

JD Vance and Marco Rubio at the first Critical Minerals Ministerial event on Wednesday

The US has launched an effort to form a trade zone for critical minerals that are key to making everything from smartphones to weapons as it tries to break China's dominance of the industry.

On Wednesday, the State Department hosted the first Critical Minerals Ministerial event - which was attended by countries and organisations including the UK, European Union, Japan, India, South Korea, Australia and the Democratic Republic of Congo.

Delegates discussed the availability of and access to minerals crucial to the manufacture of things like computer chips and electric vehicle batteries.

The mining and processing of such critical minerals, which include rare earths, is dominated by China.

In remarks released by the US government, Vice President JD Vance and Secretary of State Marco Rubio did not mention China by name.

Instead, Vance referred to the ""foreign supply"" of such minerals flooding global markets, making it difficult for other countries with mineral deposits to secure the financing needed to produce them.

The US planned to use tariffs to stop critical mineral prices falling too low, which can deter investment, he said.

David Copley, a special assistant to President Donald Trump, said the US intends to ""deploy hundreds of billions of capital into the mining sector to get projects going"".

Investments have already been made in several companies, including rare earths magnets maker MP Materials and Lithium Americas, which produces material key to rechargeable batteries, he said.

US Trade Representative Jamieson Greer also said that the US, Japan and the European Commission are developing ""coordinated trade policies and mechanisms"" in order to collectively avoid potential issues with access to important minerals.

Ahead of the meeting, a Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said ""countries need to follow the principles of market economy and international economic and trade rules, step up communication and dialogue"".

The event was part of a broader effort by the US government to counter China's ability to use its dominance of the industry as leverage in trade negotiations.

On Monday, Trump announced the creation of a critical mineral reserve, called ""Project Vault"", worth almost $12bn (£8.8bn).

Industry figures welcomed the announcement.

""It's critical to see the United States take decisive steps to shore up our supply of all kinds of minerals and rare earths,"" said Wade Senti, president of Advanced Magnet Lab.

Wednesday's event took place on the same day that 

Trump had a phone call with his Chinese counterpart Xi Jinping

, which the US president described as ""very positive.""

China has a chokehold on rare earths and has tightened its grip over exports in recent months.

Beijing requires companies in China to get government approval before shipping the minerals abroad.

When 

the curbs were tightened in October

 it dealt a major blow to the US, whose industries are heavily dependent on these imports.

The Chinese government soon eased those stricter measures but analysts say it is using its dominance as a key bargaining chip in trade talks with Washington.

Watch: Bezos should take responsibility for Washington Post layoffs, ex-editor tells BBC

The Washington Post has announced it is laying off one-third of its work force, sharply scaling back the paper's coverage of sports and foreign news.

The cuts, announced on Wednesday, will impact employees across departments with roles in the newsroom's sports, local and foreign sections hit particularly hard. 

It marks the latest upheaval for the leading US newspaper, which is owned by billionaire Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon.

Executive editor Matt Murray said the cuts would bring ""stability"". But the announcement was met with condemnation from the paper's employees and some former leaders, one of  whom described it as among the  ""darkest days in the history of"" the storied newspaper.

""Today's news is painful. These are difficult actions,"" Murray wrote in a note to staff on Wednesday.

""If we are to thrive, not just endure, we must reinvent our journalism and our business model with renewed ambition.""

In his explanation of the cuts, Murray said that the paper's online traffic had plummeted in the last three years amid the artificial intelligence boom, and that it was ""too rooted in a different era"".

""Even as we produce much excellent work, we too often write from one perspective, for one slice of the audience,"" he said.

Ahead of the announcement, foreign correspondents and local reporters had pleaded with Bezos to preserve their jobs.

""Continuing to eliminate workers only stands to weaken the newspaper, drive away readers and undercut The Post's mission,"" the Washington Post Guild said in a statement on Wednesday.

Laid off journalists took to social media, with many voicing anger about the decision to scale back coverage of foreign news. 

The paper's former Cairo bureau chief said she was laid off alongside the ""entire roster"" of Middle East correspondents and editors. A correspondent based in Ukraine lamented losing her job ""in the middle of a warzone"".

Another reporter said most of the paper's metro section, which is focused on news in the Washington DC region, had also been laid off.

Marty Baron, who served as The Post's editor until 2021, called it ""among the darkest days in the history of one of the world's greatest news organizations"".

He said Bezos, who bought the newspaper for $250mn in 2013, had spoken ""forcefully and eloquently of a free press"" during his tenure as the paper's editor, which encompassed President Donald Trump's first term in the White House.

But, Baron added: ""I wish I detected the same spirit today. There is no sign of it.""

Bloomberg via Getty Images

A spokesperson for The Post said in a statement that the steps were ""designed to strengthen our footing and sharpen our focus"".

The layoffs mark the latest in a series of staff cuts and buyouts across The Post's departments in recent years, amid backlash to some of the paper's editorial decisions.

The newspaper swiftly lost tens of thousands of subscribers after it announced, shortly before the 2024 US presidential election, that it would 

not endorse a presidential candidate

 - a decision made by billionaire owner Bezos.

The move broke with decades of tradition, with the paper having endorsed a candidate in most presidential elections since the 1970s - all of whom had been Democrats.

Bezos' move last year to focus the paper's opinion section on ""personal liberties and free markets"" prompted the editor of that section to resign.

The Post's financial woes and falling subscriber base stand in contrast to The New York Times, which reported on Wednesday that it added about 450,000 digital-only subscribers in the last quarter of 2025.

PM Law has its headquarters in Shepcote Lane, Sheffield

An investigation has begun after the sudden closure of a major law firm left hundreds of staff and clients in limbo.

Sheffield-based PM Law, which runs firms in Yorkshire, Cumbria, Berkshire, Derbyshire and Kent specialising in personal injury, wills and conveyancing, shut without warning on Monday.

One customer said they had been about to complete on a flat sale when they found they could no longer contact PM Law, while an employee said she was left ""devastated"" by the closure.

The Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) said as a result of its initial inquiries, it had taken the decision to ""intervene into the group of firms"". PM Law has been approached for comment.

The SRA explained that an intervention meant ""we take possession of all documents and papers held by the firm, take possession of all money held by the firm (including clients' money), and, where a firm is still trading, close it with immediate effect"".

Mick Lunney/BBC

A notice taped to the window at the firm's headquarters in Sheffield said it had ceased trading due to ""regulatory matters""

According to its website, PM Law employed over 600 people at firms, including Proddow Mackay, Butterworths Solicitors, WB Pennine Solicitors and Angela Viney Conveyancing Services.

Several employees reported turning up for work on Monday to discover a notice on the window explaining the business could no longer trade because of ""regulatory matters"".

Others noticed something was amiss when they were locked out from internal systems.

One member of staff, who did not wish to be named, said there had been no explanation about what had happened or what employees were expected to do next.

""I'm devastated at the way they've treated us,"" she told the BBC.

""They've not given us the time. Usually in these kind of situations, where a company's going under, they generally put a plan in place. But there's nothing at all. It's just soul destroying.""

The woman, who had worked at the office in Shepcote Lane, Sheffield, for more than a decade, said there had been no indication of what was happening.

""We should have been going on a night out this Friday, the building was supposed to be starting refurbishment,"" she said.

""So, it's not just the staff and clients, [but also] contractors. The domino effect is just massive.""

She urged the company to provide guidance to people and advice on next steps.

""There's not even been an apology,"" she said.

""Lord knows what's happened. It's got to be something catastrophic for it to happen overnight.""

Melanie Griffin said her father-in-law had been trying to sell a property

Melanie Griffin, from Penistone, in South Yorkshire, said her father-in-law had been going through a complex house sale with WB Pennine Solicitors when they found out about the issues with PM Law via social media.

She said they had contacted their own solicitor to try to transfer her father‑in‑law's files away from the firm but had been unable to contact anyone at WB Pennine Solicitors.

""It's already been a bit of a stressful situation, obviously house moving and everything else,"" she said.

""We're just hoping for some answers.""

'So much on the line'

Cinematographer Joe Hofmann said he had been left in limbo as he tried to buy a flat in Forest Hill, south east London.

The sudden closure of the company has seriously affected people's lives, he said.

""We've been thrown into it, with so much on the line,"" he said.

A conveyancer he had used previously had recommended PM Law, but he said recent months had seen the company fail to complete tasks and miss deadlines.

He said he was hours away from transferring a huge sum to complete the purchase of the flat, only to find he was unable to contact the solicitors.

To date, he has had no information about what happens next as he, and the property chain he is part of, wait for news.

He is also worried about all of his personal information and documents being held by PM Law.

The SRA said it had been inundated with calls about PM Law since Monday.

Sarah Rapson, its chief executive, said: ""The sudden announcement from PM Law on Monday that they had closed is troubling news and I fully sympathise with the clients of the firm. 

""Many of those involved are buying and selling a house or dealing with personal injury claims. These matters can be stressful enough without the added complication of your solicitor's firm closing during the process.

""While we cannot disclose information about an on-going investigation, we are working quickly to gather all the relevant information and provide answers to those that have raised important questions about their on-going matters with the firm.

""Finally, we also recognise that this is a difficult time for the employees of the firm who have sadly lost their jobs this week.""

The SRA said an intervention agent would ""contact clients with ongoing matters, prioritising those with the most urgent or imminent issues.""

Shares in the Danish company which makes Ozempic and Wegovy plunged 18%, as its boss warned things would get worse before they improve following steep price cuts.

Novo Nordisk had reported it expected profits and sales to fall by as much as 13%, and on Wednesday chief executive Maziar Mike Doustdar called pricing pressures ""unprecedented"" and ""painful"".

Novo Nordisk said the situation had been ""amplified"" by a deal the firm and its rival Eli Lilly made with US President Donald Trump 

to lower the cost of weight-loss drugs

 for Americans.

The company has faced turmoil in recent months, 

announcing thousands of job cuts

 amid warnings of increasing competition and the impact of patents expiring.

Doustdar, who was appointed chief executive last summer, said he hoped the price reduction in Wegovy would be ""an investment for our future"" and open up access to the drug to more people.

People should expect the company's share price ""goes down before it comes back up,"" he told CNBC's ""Early Edition Europe"".

Weight-loss drugs like Novo Nordisk's Ozempic and Wegovy and Eli Lilly's Zepbound and Mounjaro have soared in popularity over the last few years, and competition between the firms has driven down prices.

Patent expiry has also led to rise of low-cost copycat weight-loss drugs, with 

warnings about the safety of some of them

.

Novo Nordisk's chief financial officer Karsten Munk Knudsen told the BBC's World Business Express that its Indian and Chinese patents on semaglutide - the technical name for the drug used to treat type 2 diabetes and obesity - expire in ""a few months' time"".

He said this would lead to increased competition from similar treatments and expected a ""2% impact on group sales for this year"".

Asked about falling prices, he said: ""We're absolutely not in a race to the bottom, but we are in a race to expand the market in a rational way.""

'Most favoured nation'

In the US, Trump has pushed to make weight-loss medication cheaper after he complained that the ""fat drugs"" were more expensive there than in other countries.

In November, he announced the ""most favoured nation"" agreement with Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly. 

He said at the time that users of government-run website 

TrumpRx

 would be able to get Wegovy and Zepbound from $350 (£255) per month on average and that this would to drop to $250 a month. He added that Medicare prices of Ozempic, Wegovy, Mounjaro and Zepbound will be $245.

Many weight-loss drugs cost over $1,000 a month in the US without insurance or discounts.

Novo Nordisk said on Tuesday that ""lower realised prices linked to investments in market access, amplified by the [most favoured nation] agreement with the US Administration to bring GLP-1s [weight-loss drugs] to more Americans at a lower cost is assumed"" in its lower and sales profit guidance.

It added that ""intensifying competition and negative impacts from the compound patent expiry [...] in certain markets"" had also hit its sales and profit guidance. 

Side effects and bad news

Later on Wednesday, the share price of Novo Nordisk's US rival Eli Lilly rose after it told investors that profits and sales would be higher than expected.

Dan Coatsworth, an analyst at AJ Bell, said key to Eli Lilly's success was that it had done a much better job than Novo Nordisk of tackling the side effects of weight-loss drugs.

""There is a lot of work, and it's a very slow process, but [Eli Lilly] just seems to be coming out of it very well,"" he said.

He added investors have also been more willing to put money into Eli Lilly than into its competitor Novo Nordisk, which has had ""a succession of bad news"", following last year's change in chief executive, and jobs cuts announced in September.

Pinterest has sacked two engineers for tracking which workers lost their jobs in a recent round of layoffs.

The company recently announced job cuts, with chief executive Bill Ready stating in an email he was ""doubling down on an AI-forward approach,"" according to an employee who posted some of the memo on LinkedIn.

Pinterest told investors the move would impact about 15% of the workforce, or roughly 700 roles, without saying which teams or workers were affected.

But then ""two engineers wrote custom scripts improperly accessing confidential company information to identify the locations and names of all dismissed employees and then shared it more broadly,"" a company spokesperson told the BBC.

""This was a clear violation of Pinterest policy and of their former colleagues' privacy,"" the spokesperson added.

A script in this sense is essentially computer code written to automate a task within existing software or tweak its functionality for a specific purpose.

The script written by the Pinterest engineers was aimed at internal tools used at the company for employees to communicate, according to a person familiar with the firings who asked not to be identified.

The person said the script created an alert for which employee names within a tool like the team communication platform Slack were being removed or deactivated, giving some insight into who at the company was impacted by the layoffs.

The identities of the two sacked engineers are not publicly known and the BBC has been unable to contact them.

The technology industry has seen waves of layoffs in recent years.

Checking Slack and other internal tools for coworkers who disappear from channels of conversation is a common way for people to learn who is no longer working at a company.

In the same week that Pinterest announced it was laying off workers, 

Amazon cut 16,000 roles

 in its second round of redundancies in three months.

Earlier this year, Meta also laid off several hundred employees.

Along with Amazon and Meta, Google, Microsoft and others have significantly cut their workforces.

Across the entire tech industry, an estimated 700,000 people have been laid off over the last four years, according to Layoffs.fyi, which tracks all reports of such cuts.

Walmart has become the first traditional retailer to hit a $1tn (£730bn) market valuation, propelling it into a small group dominated by tech firms.

The milestone reflects the US retail giant's booming e-commerce business and its success in drawing in price-conscious shoppers. Wall Street has also responded enthusiastically to its investments in artificial intelligence (AI).

Walmart joins an elite club of mostly tech firms, including Nvidia and Alphabet, with valuations over $1tn.

The company's share price, which has soared in recent months, rose by more than 3% on Tuesday. 

Walmart is the biggest brick-and-mortar retailer in the US and is known for its low prices. It has benefited from a trend of higher earners trading down to lower-priced items, as the jobs market cools and inflation persists. Its speedy home delivery offering has also enticed shoppers from households across income brackets.

It 

reported strong sales

 across key sectors in its most recent earnings update in November, including grocery and clothing.

""Walmart is better insulated than just about anybody given the value proposition we have,"" John David Rainey, Walmart's chief financial officer, said at the time.

Walmart executives have said the effects of US President Donald Trump's tariffs have been more muted than initially expected. While tariffs have raised prices for items like electronics and toys, the retailer's scale has allowed it to weather the import taxes better than some rivals

.

Walmart's online business has helped it emerge as a competitor to Amazon. E-commerce sales in the US jumped 28% in the three months to 31 October, propelled by online orders and advertising.

Still, Amazon's market value currently stands at $2.6tn - more than double Walmart's.

Wall Street investors have embraced Walmart's adoption of AI, helping push the company's valuation to new highs.

The firm reached the $1tn milestone during chief executive John Furner's first week at the helm of the company. Furner has been a vocal backer of its AI investments.

The company in October announced a partnership with OpenAI, which it said ""allows customers and Sam's Club members to plan meals, restock essentials, or discover new products simply by chatting"".

Walmart's decision late last year to move its stock from the New York Stock Exchange to the tech-heavy Nasdaq reinforced the retailer's push to be seen as a digital company.

Walmart is the first traditional retailer to join the $1tn market capitalisation club. The group is still dominated by tech giants, though investment firm Berkshire Hathaway reached the milestone in 2024.

Drug-maker Eli Lilly also surpassed $1tn late last year before falling back below the threshold.

Wild fluctuations in the price of gold continued on Wednesday as geopolitical tensions reignited after the US 

downed an Iranian drone

.

The precious metal, which is seen as a so-called ""safe haven"" for investors in times of uncertainty, shot back above $5,000 (£3,650) an ounce following days of sharp falls. 

Gold prices had been 

propelled to record highs

 by rapid changes in US trade policy, ongoing geopolitical uncertainty and conflict and central banks increasing their purchases of bullion.

Wednesday's jump, to $5,061 per ounce,  left the price of gold around 80% higher than the same time a year ago.

A US military spokesman confirmed the Iranian drone had been shot down after it ""aggressively approached"" an American aircraft carrier in the Arabian Sea.

Tehran has not commented on Tuesday's incident.

Gold prices peaked at $5,500 in January but last Friday tumbled after US President Donald Trump nominated Kevin Warsh as chair of the Federal Reserve. 

Warsh is viewed by investors as a relatively safe pick, calming concerns about the independence of the central bank following attacks by Trump against the current chair Jerome Powell and the pace of interest rate cuts. 

Friday's drop

, which saw the gold price fall 9%, was its biggest one-day decline since 1983.

Emma Wall, chief investment strategist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the rise in the gold price is ""mostly fuelled by speculators buying the dip"".

""The slump proved too enticing to ignore and the fundamental drivers of the metal are intact,"" she said.

But she warned that there is likely to be more volatility to come, with interest rate decisions in the US, mid-term elections in November and continuing tensions in Ukraine and the Middle East.

Silver has also recovered some losses seen over recent says with prices climbing by around 5% to $92 an ounce on Wednesday. 

The metal saw far more dramatic falls than gold after January's surge, plunging by 27% in a single day on Friday.

But, despite being well off January's peak of over $120, silver is still worth almost three times what it was this time a year ago.

Lindsay James, investment strategist at Quilter, said gold has been ""incredibly volatile"", but pointed to factors supporting higher prices in the long term.

She said central banks from China to Poland were continuing to buy bullion, propping up its price.

James added: ""With market jitters also creeping in around the disruption caused by AI to software and technology companies, investors will often flock to safe haven assets until such storms pass.""

Ted Sarandos, chief executive officer of Netflix, and Bruce Campbell, chief revenue and strategy officer at Warner Bros Discovery, are sworn in during a Senate hearing

Netflix struggled to reassure sceptical lawmakers that its proposed $82bn (£61bn) takeover of Warner Bros Discovery would benefit consumers, workers and the broader entertainment industry.

On Tuesday, members of the US Senate antitrust subcommittee, which includes both Democrats and Republicans, raised concerns about reduced competition, potential price rises and the future of cinemas if the merger goes ahead.

The deal, which is currently under review by the Department of Justice (DoJ), would give Netflix control of Warner Bros' film and television studios as well as the HBO Max streaming service. 

Rival bidder Paramount Skydance continues to push a competing offer to buy the company.

The Senators' questioning highlighted bipartisan opposition to the merger. But DoJ regulators have the authority to decide whether to approve or block the deal.

During the hearing, senators quizzed Netflix co‑chief executive Ted Sarandos on the fate of theatres if the deal were to be approved, the effects of the merger on subscription prices and on the entertainment workforce.

Sarandos said his company would commit to releasing Warner Bros films for a 45‑day theatrical period - the current industry standard - and pledged to run the studio ""largely as it is today"".

He argued that combining the two companies would ""give consumers more content for less"", noting that 80% of those who subscribe to HBO Max - a streaming service that is part of Warner Bros' library - also pay for Netflix. 

He also insisted the merger would create more American jobs.

But Republican Senator Mike Lee warned that ""consolidating two major employers within the same market inevitably has an impact on, and can significantly weaken, competition for that labour"".

Although several Republican Senators expressed concern about competition issues, some also focused on the ongoing culture‑war debate.

Senator Eric Schmitt, a Republican, accused Netflix content programming of being ""overwhelmingly woke"".

One party notably absent from the hearing was David Ellison, the chief executive of Paramount, which is still vying to acquire Warner Bros despite being repeatedly rebuffed. 

Paramount, which is backed by the billionaire Ellison family, has argued that the company's $108bn deal for the company is superior. 

Critics have condemned both merger proposals, saying either deal would consolidate too much power in the hands of one company.

Senator Cory Booker, a Democrat, called Paramount's absence from the hearing ""frustrating"", and said David Ellison had declined his invitation to testify.

""With either merger, another corporation will have that increased control over what we see, what we hear and what news we consume,"" Booker said.

Netflix, which is seeking to fend off rival Paramount in its bid for the Hollywood studio, last month

 updated its offer

 and said it would pay entirely in cash after suggesting it would fund the transaction through a mix of cash and shares.

The subcommittee hearing also considered whether Alphabet's YouTube is a key competitor to Netflix.

Sarandos argued that ""we are competing for the same content, we are competing for the same viewers, we are competing often for the same ad dollars"".

""YouTube is not just cat videos anymore. YouTube is TV,"" he added.

But some lawmakers, including Lee, remained sceptical of those claims, arguing that YouTube should not be considered a rival. Paramount has also pushed back against those arguments.

The figure is significant but well below the 11.48 million people who filed in time (generic photo)

An estimated one million people missed the deadline to file their tax return and now face penalties, according to HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC).

The UK's tax authority said 27,456 people filed in the final hour before the cut-off for 2024-25 returns at midnight at the end of Saturday.

After HMRC helplines stayed open and webchat services were extended at the weekend, the busiest hour of people filing through online self-assessment was from 17:00 GMT on Saturday.

Some 475,722 people filed on the final day out of a total of about 11.5 million submissions. Those who missed the deadline face an automatic £100 penalty.

""Thank you to the millions of people and agents who filed their self assessment tax return and paid any tax owed by 31 January. Anyone who missed the deadline should file their return as soon as possible, as penalties and late payment interest may be charged,"" said Myrtle Lloyd, HMRC's chief customer officer.

Millions of people have tax automatically deducted from their wages through PAYE (pay-as-you-earn), but those with more than one source of income may need to file each year through self-assessment.

They included those earning more than £1,000 in the 2024-25 financial year from self-employment or by letting out a property or land.

Some who were not required to file this time include those earning more than £150,000, whose high income was the only reason they needed to file previously, or those who had switched to paying the high income child benefit charge through PAYE.

A similar number of people missed the filing deadline a year earlier. Anyone doing so faces the following penalties: 

An initial £100 fixed penalty, even if there is no tax to pay, or if the tax due is paid on time

After three months, there could also be additional daily penalties of £10 per day, up to a maximum of £900

After six months, there could be a further penalty of 5% of the tax due or £300, whichever is greater. After 12 months, there could be another 5% or £300 charge, whichever is greater

There are also additional penalties for late payments of 5% of the tax unpaid at 30 days, six months and 12 months

If tax remains unpaid after the deadline, interest may also be charged on the amount owed

HMRC, which raises tens of millions of pounds each year from penalties, will consider customers' reasons for missing the deadline. Those with a 

reasonable excuse

 may avoid being fined.

Tax analysts advise anyone appealing to still pay the initial penalty.

""Although it involves shelling out cash, it avoids you paying interest on the penalty itself from the date it became due if you lose your appeal,"" said Charlene Young, senior pensions and savings expert at investment platform AJ Bell.

""If you don't have an excuse to appeal a fine but still owe money, you might still be able to set up a payment plan to get back on track. It's essential you don't put your head in the sand.""

Walt Disney has named Josh D'Amaro, the head of its amusement park business, as its new chief executive.

D'Amaro, a 28-year veteran of the company, will replace current boss Bob Iger. He is due to start in the new role on 18 March.

In selecting D'Amaro, Disney has turned to the leader of the part of its business that has delivered the most reliable profits in recent years, as the company works to find its way in the world of streaming. 

The decision ends a succession puzzle for the entertainment giant, which Iger has led for roughly two decades, except for a brief interlude that ended in 2022 when the board ousted his successor and asked Iger to return.

Iger quickly set about restructuring the firm, aiming to tackle ballooning expenses in the streaming, television and film business, regain momentum for sports-focused ESPN and expand its parks and cruise lines.  

In the announcement, Iger said he was ""proud to step away at a moment when Disney's future has never been brighter"".

D'Amaro joined the company in 1998 at Disneyland Resort, before rising to his current position as chairman of the Disney Experiences division, which has 185,000 employees and generated $36bn in revenue last year.

In the role, the 54-year-old oversees 12 theme parks and 54 resorts globally. 

He has handled projects such as World of Frozen and Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge, as well as managing digital ventures such as Disney's collaboration with the firm behind Fortnite. 

In an interview on CNBC, Disney board chair James Gorman said D'Amaro brought not just financial skills but ""great creative touch"".

Ex-Disney boss Iger in shock return to media giant

As chief executive, D'Amaro will be taking on the top role at a moment when media companies in the US are facing increased political pressure. 

Disney itself has been a prime target, blasted in recent years by Republicans such as Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for promoting ""woke"" values. 

The company most recently drew headlines when it temporarily suspended comedian Jimmy Kimmel, a decision linked to comments over the killing of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Disney's parks business in the US has also drawn attention for rising costs faced by visitors, while investors have been frustrated with its share price, which has lagged that of other publicly listed firms. 

Shares dipped 1% in early trading after the announcement.

 

D'Amaro will receive a $2.5m base salary, as well as Disney shares worth at least $26.3m annually, according to company filings. The firm has also granted him a bonus award worth $9.7m this year for the new role.

Disney also named Dana Walden, currently co-chair of its entertainment business, to a new role as chief creative officer, reporting to D'Amaro.  

Walden, who is known outside of work for her friendship with former Vice President Kamala Harris, had been seen as D'Amaro's chief rival for the top job.

Disney is trying to avoid a repeat of 2020's botched hand-off. 

That year, it also elevated the successful head of the theme parks business, Bob Chapek, to chief executive. But within weeks, the Covid-19 pandemic had forced the company to shut its doors. 

His tenure was marked by strains on the content side of the business, which saw costs rise, as well as the brand's involvement in several high-profile public clashes, including with actress Scarlett Johansson.

Analyst Paolo Pescatore warned that, despite the profits delivered by parks, the key to Disney's success lies in its content.

""Disney can ill afford another messy handover,"" he said. ""While it is a strong endorsement of D'Amaro's abilities to elevate Experiences to the fore.... he should not lose sight of Disney's core capabilities.""

The price of Doritos in the US will drop by just under 15%

PepsiCo is to cut the prices of some of its snack products in the US, following backlash against previous price hikes and pressure in the face of appetite-suppressing GLP-1 jabs.

Products including Doritos, Lays (known as Walkers in the UK) and Cheetos will be cheaper in the US from this week.

The snack conglomerate said it was ""listening closely to customers"" who are ""feeling the strain"" of the rising cost of living.

Food companies are also reckoning with changing consumer appetites as GLP-1 weight loss jabs such as Wegovy and Ozempic grow in popularity, leading users to eat less.

The products in line for price cuts will not see their packaging size, ingredients or taste changed, PepsiCo promised.

But the conglomerate stressed that product prices are only recommendations, with shelf prices are ultimately set by retailers.

The price-cutting drive was deliberately launched ahead of the Super Bowl on February 8, traditionally one of the most lucrative days of the year for snack makers.

The company, which also owns Quaker Oats, Gatorade and Lipton iced tea,  reported revenue of $29.34bn (£21.14bn) for the three months to 27 December. 

Its chief executive Ramon Laguarta said it was ""betting a lot on portion control"".

Many GLP-1 users have reported that their spending on food decreased considerably after starting the jab, as they felt a lot less hungry.

Laguarta said PepsiCo would focus more on multipacks as customers prioritised portion control. More than 70% of its food products in the US are single-serve.

The firm is also pivoting towards health-focused products, with the launch of Doritos Protein later this year.

But the company said its biggest challenge at the moment is affordability.

""We've spent the past year listening closely to consumers, and they've told us they're feeling the strain,"" PepsiCo's US food chief, Rachel Ferdinando, said.

""Lowering the suggested retail price reflects our commitment to help reduce the pressure where we can.""

PepsiCo shares rose nearly 4% in early trading on Tuesday. They fell about 5% in 2025 and have lagged behind rival Coca-Cola for the last five years.

The company said 2026 will be a ""record year of productivity savings"".

Although US inflation is easing, food companies are still facing higher costs from tariffs on materials like aluminium. 

Beyond tariffs, rising labour costs and extreme weather are also pushing prices up.

Consumers have expressed ire at ""shrinkflation"", where products are made smaller but the price stays the same.

Several PepsiCo products were hit with 

shrinkflation ""warning"" stickers in French supermarket chain Carrefour

 in 2023.

The following year, Carrefour said it would stop selling PepsiCo products in several European countries due to 

""unacceptable"" price rises

Eluned Morgan, pictured at Welsh Labour's 2024 conference, says her government can't be expected ""to step in and do the work that the public should be doing""

The public need to stop watching Netflix, ""get out of their homes"" and go to the pub for a drink to save struggling businesses, the Welsh first minister says.

Eluned Morgan spoke in Wales' parliament, the Senedd, after her government announced a one-year business rate discount of 15% for pubs, restaurants, cafes and live music venues.

She came under fire over how her government taxes companies, and replied that the state could not be expected to ""step in"" and do the work of people not using hospitality businesses.

Opposition leaders accused Morgan of blaming others instead of taking responsibility for the difficulties facing the sector.

Senedd prepares for 'once in a century change' - but do voters know?

The Welsh plans for business rate cuts are two years shorter than 

a similar scheme in England

 for pubs and live music venues.

The UK government's English scheme will see pubs get a 15% discount from April, and their business rates frozen for a further two years.

The Welsh government's business rate regime came in for criticism on Tuesday from  Plaid Cymru leader Rhun ap Iorwerth, who told the Senedd the ""hospitality sector is facing an existential crisis"" and the system needed ""urgent and radical change"".

Morgan replied: ""If people want to see those businesses succeed, they need to use them. 

""They need to stop buying things online. They need to get out of their homes and stop watching Netflix.

""They need to stop buying that bottle of wine at home and go out to the pub. That is the reality of what's happening here. 

""You can't expect the state to step in and do the work that the public should be doing.""

Later, ap Iorwerth said: ""This is a first minister that is completely out of touch - she has form for blaming others instead of taking responsibility for the government's own failures.""

Welsh Conservative Senedd leader Darren Millar said Morgan ""has tried to blame Brexit and Donald Trump for Wales' economic woes, now she's blaming Welsh citizens and Netflix"".

Welsh Lib Dem leader Jane Dodds said: ""People are not willingly choosing Netflix over the high street. They are being forced indoors because prices keep rising and wages are not.""

Reform said it was ""Labour, not Netflix, that is causing pub closures"".

Wales's business rates cut is two years shorter than a similar scheme in England for pubs and live music venues

Asked why the its scheme was for a single year, the Welsh government said decisions for 2027/28 and beyond will be for the next Senedd. Wales goes to the polls in just three months time.

Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford said ministers know hospitality and music venues are ""facing real pressures, from rising costs to changing consumer habits"" and the cut would help 4,400 businesses.

It comes after complaints that rising property valuations have left some Welsh companies facing sharp increases in their bills.

The UK government's decision to cut rates in England also followed a backlash against its November budget which left many facing major increases, and led to more than a thousand pubs banning Labour MPs from their premises.

Business rates in Wales are controlled by the Welsh government and collected by local councils.

Trade body UKHospitality Cymru welcomed the inclusion of restaurants and cafes in the Welsh scheme, but said it was ""notable"" it was for one year only.

""Rates bills will still be going up year-on-year, even for those receiving relief, and hotels, which were facing the biggest increases, have been excluded completely,"" it added.

Chris Charters, director of the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) Wales, welcomed the rate discount - but said the revaluation in property values ""could still lead to more of our locals in Wales being forced to close for good"".

The comments by Morgan followed a clash with the Senedd's Tory leader Millar, where he accused her of not giving a ""straight answer"" over whether Labour would rule out income tax rises after the next Senedd election.

When asked, the first minister said it will be made clear in her manifesto.

""Your plan is simply to follow Plaid Cymru's lead, to reach your hands deeper into the pockets of those hard-working people,"" he said.

Morgan said: ""You want to cut the basic rates of income tax? Then you have to tell people that they will have to wait longer for those waiting lists to come down.""

Irn-Bru is the brand's biggest seller

The makers of Irn-Bru have bought two rival soft drinks brands Fentimans and Frobishers in a deal worth more than £50m.

AG Barr purchased the Hexham-based botanical brewery and fizzy drinks brand Fentimans for about £38m, in a move funded through a combination of cash and debt.

It also closed a deal at the end of its financial year to January to buy Devon-based juice business Frobishers for £13m.

The company said the two brands both reflect the consumer's move away from alcoholic beverages to ""adult soft drinks"".

The acquisitions come as Barr, whose other main brands include Rubicon, Funkin and Boost, reported a ""strong"" financial year, with increases in sales and profitability.  

It said it was set for a double-digit hike in annual profits as annual revenues rose to about £437m - a 4% increase on the previous year.

AG Barr was set up in Falkirk in 1875, with the soft drink manufacturer now based in Cumbernauld. 

The brand is also known for soft drinks such as Rio and Snapple but has been expanding into new categories such as plant-based milks, health shots and low-calorie drinks to keep up with consumer demand for healthier products.

AG Barr is looking to capitalise on the growth of upmarket non-alcoholic alternatives amid falling alcohol sales, with Fentimans and Frobishers fitting that category.

""Both brands operate in the adult soft drinks market, which is benefitting from the consumer trend of reduced alcohol consumption,"" the company said.

""These acquisitions reflect the execution of further meaningful and targeted mergers and acquisitions to elevate growth through broadening the brand portfolio while providing opportunities for cost synergies.""

The firm said Irn-Bru had ""modest growth"" in the final six months of the year after failing to grow in the first half, while ""a good performance"" from Rubicon and Boost helped to offset a decline for the Funkin ready-to-drink cocktail range.

Euan Sutherland, chief executive of AG Barr, said: ""Our top and bottom-line performance for full-year 2025-26 is in line with expectations, and importantly we have laid strong foundations for future growth.

""We enter 2026-27 with good momentum in our core brands and from the introduction of exciting new products.""

Betting on the non-drinkers

For some of us, Dry January has just come to an end, 

writes Business Correspondent David Henderson.

But with these acquisitions, AG Barr has placed a £50m bet that this trend may last much longer.

It says consumers are choosing to drink less alcohol and Fentimans and Frobisher have made their mark in the adult soft drinks market.

With its ginger beer and fancy colas, Fentimans taps into the growing ""mindful drinking"" trend.

For half a century, Frobishers has produced apple juice. Lately, it's offered a wider range of sparkling drinks and cordials.

Both owe their growth to changes in drinking habits.

Many of us, it seems, are swapping a traditional pint or glass or wine for a soft drink.

The proportion of non-drinkers in Scotland has increased, rising from 11% in 2003 to 20% in 2024.

And recent data suggests that overall Scots are drinking less alcohol, with consumption now at its lowest level for more than two decades.

Barr already own a range of other soft drinks brands, including Rubicon and Bundaberg.

These latest acquisitions give them even more scope to profit from a growing trend.

EU has 'open mind' on UK customs union debate

Brussels would be ""open‑minded"" about discussing closer trade ties with the UK, including the possibility of working together on a customs union, the European Commissioner for finance has told the BBC.

Valdis Dombrovskis said the bloc was ""ready to engage"" if the UK wanted to explore the move, an idea Labour has faced growing pressure to consider.

Speaking after high-level talks with ministers including Chancellor Rachel Reeves, he also said Britain and the EU could remove ""most"" food checks between the UK and the bloc.

He also opened the door to Britain entering the EU's €150bn ($177bn; £130bn) defence loans scheme after talks on an agreement broke down last year.

Dombrovskis's intervention marked the strongest comments yet from Brussels about its willingness to re-engage with Britain amid mounting global uncertainty.

At an event with Dombrovskis in London on Monday, Reeves argued stronger ties are increasingly important as ""we are sliding towards a world where the rules are less clear"".

A customs union would eliminate tariffs or taxes on some or all goods between the UK and the EU, reducing bureaucracy.

But critics point out that it would also severely curtail the UK's ability to strike bespoke global trade deals, as the EU would place a common tariff on all goods from outside the customs union area and would expect the UK to conform to common standards.

Labour's election manifesto ruled out signing up to the existing EU customs union.

The party also said it would not rejoin the EU's single market, where countries adopt common laws in some areas to make it easier to trade goods and services. 

Calls for a customs union with the EU have been growing among Labour MPs, while Justice Secretary David Lammy said one could boost economic growth.

Asked by the BBC whether Brussels would welcome talks on Britain rejoining the customs union, Dombrovskis said: ""I cannot jump to conclusions, but I can say that we are ready to engage with an open mind and seek those areas of cooperation.""

He also said the EU was certainly  ""open to discuss different areas as regards a single market"" - a policy closer to the PMs preferred direction of alignment across a number of sectors. He also stressed that the most ""mutually beneficial"" arrangement would be membership of the single market but that would require the ""four freedoms"" including freedom of movement.

The single market relies on a country accepting ""the four freedoms"": freedom of movement, goods, services and capital.

Reeves hosted Dombrovskis and European Commissioner for Trade Maroš Šefčovič, alongside cabinet ministers Peter Kyle and Nick Thomas Symonds.

The group - dubbed the ""Quint"" by diplomats - aims to meet regularly to coordinate responses to the drastic changes to the trade and economic environment in recent months.

While the group will not formally negotiate a Brexit reset, its existence signals a desire on both sides to cooperate given global uncertainty.

At the meeting, Reeves told the group the UK and EU ""share values and objectives when it comes to the economy, to trade, and to security"".

She also emphasised the ""need to work together and as far as possible speak with one voice"".

Labour has already struck several side deals with the EU, including a major agreement on food standards which is yet to be finalised.

Dombrovskis said that, once in place, it could end almost all checks on goods moving between Britain and the EU - something which has led to chaos for firms trading across the border - provided the UK aligns with EU sanitary and phytosanitary rules.

He also said talks on a youth mobility scheme were ""very advanced"".

But one area in which progress has stalled is Britain's participation in the Security Action for Europe (SAFE) scheme, a massive programme of borrowing to help EU countries buy defence equipment.

British companies would currently be limited to supplying 35% of the total value of a finished defence product, and talks over an enhanced deal broke down in November.

Asked whether he would consider a new agreement, Dombrovskis said: ""We are open for further discussions, we know the prime minister has expressed interest, actually, to come back to this issue, and there is certainly openness from the EU side for this.""

The Liberal Democrats, having campaigned for Britain to enter talks over a customs union with the EU, hailed the comments from Dombrovskis as ""a significant moment the government simply cannot afford to ignore"".

The party's Treasury spokesperson, Daisy Cooper, said: ""Negotiating a new customs union with the EU is the fastest way to jump-start the UK economy.

""It is high time that Keir Starmer stopped making excuses and finally started working on a proper new trade deal with our European partners.""

The Conservative Party has been approached for comment.

The meetings come after a tumultuous period for international relations, which saw US President Donald Trump threaten to take control of Greenland from Denmark and impose fresh tariffs on Nato allies.

In response, the European Commission threatened to levy retaliatory tariffs on the US, with Trump eventually backing down and agreeing a deal to bolster the security of Greenland without compromising its sovereignty.

Dombrovskis said Brussels' decision to stand firm against Trump's threats was key to shift the discussion to ""a more productive"" place.

""That was clearly unacceptable, and we made it very clear from EU side, also indicating that we are ready to take counter measures if necessary,"" he added.

The French offices of Elon Musk's X have been raided by the Paris prosecutor's cyber-crime unit, as part of an investigation into suspected offences including unlawful data extraction and complicity in the possession of child pornography.

The prosecutor's office also said both Musk and former X chief executive Linda Yaccarino had been summoned to appear at hearings in April.

In a separate development, the UK's Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) announced a probe into Musk's AI tool, Grok, over its ""potential to produce harmful sexualised image and video content.""

Writing on X, Musk said the raid was a ""political attack"".

The company said 

in a statement

 that it was ""disappointed"" but ""not surprised,"" and accused the Paris Public Prosecutor's office of an ""abusive act.""

X also denied any wrongdoing and said the raid ""endangers free speech.""

The investigation began in January 2025 when French prosecutors started looking into content recommended by X's algorithm, before being widened in July that year to include Musk's controversial AI chatbot, Grok.

Yaccarino also took to X to accuse French prosecutors of carrying out ""a political vendetta against Americans.""

""To be clear: they are lying,"" added Yaccarino, who left the firm last year.

Following Tuesday's raid, French prosecutors say they are now

 

investigating whether X has broken the law across multiple areas.

Among potential crimes it said it would investigate were complicity in possession or organised distribution of images of children of a pornographic nature, infringement of people's image rights with sexual deepfakes and fraudulent data extraction by an organised group.

New UK investigation

Meanwhile, UK authorities have given an update on their investigations into sexual deepfakes created by Grok and shared on X.

The images - often made using real images of women without their consent - prompted a 

barrage of criticism

 in January from victims, online safety campaigners and politicians.

The company 

eventually intervened

 to prevent the practice, after Ofcom and others launched investigations.

In an update on Tuesday, Ofcom said it was continuing to investigate the platform and was treating it as ""a matter of urgency"".

But it added it was currently unable to investigate the creation of illegal images by Grok in this case because it did not have sufficient powers relating to chatbots.

However, shortly afterwards the ICO said 

it was launching its own probe

, in conjunction with Ofcom, into the processing of personal data in relation to the Grok.

""The reports about Grok raise deeply troubling questions about how people's personal data has been used to generate intimate or sexualised images without their knowledge or consent, and whether the necessary safeguards were put in place to prevent this,"" said William Malcolm, the ICO's executive director for regulatory risk & innovation.

In late January, the European Commission 

announced an investigation

 into its parent company xAI over concerns about the images.

A Commission spokesperson said it was in touch with France over its search of X's office in Paris.

'Not a free country'

Pavel Durov - founder of the messaging app Telegram - criticised the French authorities on Tuesday, accusing France of being ""the only country in the world that is criminally persecuting all social networks that give people some degree of freedom"". 

""Don't be mistaken: this is not a free country,"" he added 

in a post on X

.

Durov was 

arrested and detained in France

 in August 2024 over alleged moderation lapses on his messaging app, which the Paris prosecutor's office said had failed to curb criminal activity.

He was permitted to leave the country last March after the platform made some changes to the way it operates following the arrest.

These included sharing some user data 

with authorities in response to legal requests

.

It's been a wild ride for the price of gold over the past few days.

Last week, the yellow metal touched a record high above $5,500 an ounce, following a year in which its value has soared.

But on Friday, the gold price plummeted more than 9%, its sharpest one-day drop since 1983, before a further decline on Monday.

A slight recovery on Tuesday saw it rise more than 5%, and that rise continued into Wednesday. 

And, despite the recent falls, its price is still about 75% higher than it was at the same point last year.

So, what is going on?

What triggered the recent falls?

Financial markets can move for a variety of reasons, but analysts seem to agree that the decision by US President Donald Trump to 

nominate Kevin Warsh as the head of the US central bank

, the Federal Reserve, was key in this case.

Warsh is viewed by the markets as a ""very acceptable"" choice, April Larusse from Insight Investment told the BBC, amid recent worries over the independence of the Fed.

This boosted the value of the dollar and helped to calm investors' nerves. However, this easing of concerns was not so good for the gold price, which is seen as a safer investment in times of uncertainty.

Another reason cited for the slump in prices was changes to trading requirements on a major exchange, which made it more expensive for speculators to trade.

Prices of gold and silver have soared since the start of the year, and some analysts had begun to feel the rises were overdone.

Mark Matthews, head of research for Asia at Bank Julius Baer, told Reuters that one explanation for the collapse in prices is ""simply because they had already gone parabolic in the previous week"".

""Once profit-taking started, it just snowballed.""

However, some believed the falls were just a blip in gold's onward march upwards. Michael Hsueh, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, said ""conditions do not appear primed for a sustained reversal in gold prices"" and reiterated the bank expects the metal to reach $6,000 an ounce.

Why had gold been rising?

The price of gold has been rising slowly for the past few years but it really took off last year when it posted its biggest annual gain since 1979.

The precious metal is seen as the ultimate ""safe haven"" investment - providing a more secure asset in times of uncertainty.

""When you own gold, it's not attached to the debt of somebody else like a bond is or an equity where the performance of a company will drive performance,"" Nicholas Frappell, global head of institutional markets at ABC Refinery, told the BBC.

""It's a really good diversifier in a very uncertain world.""

Last year, the key worry for investors was the unpredictable changes in US trade policy, introduced by the Trump administration. 

The ""Liberation Day"" tariffs

 announced by Trump in April led to months of uncertainty as negotiations continued over what level the tariffs would be set at.

In January, Trump's threat to impose fresh tariffs on eight European countries opposed to his proposed takeover of Greenland, which has since been reversed, sent gold and silver to fresh record highs.

His trade policies continue to worry investors, helping to support the gold price, says Emma Wall, chief investment strategist at Hargreaves Lansdown.

Geopolitical tensions have also added to the appeal of gold as a safer investment, and the US seizure of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro in early January helped to push the gold price higher. 

""Gold is doing what it does best when the world feels messy, jumping amid rising trade tensions, geopolitical flare-ups, political uncertainty in the US,"" Wall says.

""Fresh friction between the US, Canada and China, unease around Europe and the Middle East, and even 

shutdown risks in Washington

 have all added to gold's appeal.""

Central bank buying

One factor which started to push up the price of gold before last year's surge was central banks increasing their purchases of bullion.

This has been a trend over the past few years, after the reserves of the Russian Central Bank were frozen following the invasion of Ukraine.

""Investors and global central banks have... favoured gold as their reserve currency of choice, which they believe insulates them from US policy dependence,"" says Wall.

""Certain nations will have observed the threat of Russia having its US dollar assets seized by global players supportive of Ukraine, and subsequently considered the metal a more attractive neutral reserve,"" she added.

Other buyers of gold include China, which is believed to be the biggest buyer of gold, with demand in the country coming from the central bank and investors, as well as individuals buying jewellery.

Investors in the west have also been attracted to gold, with many putting money into funds that own and trade the metal.

Elon Musk's SpaceX is taking over his artificial intelligence (AI) start-up, as the billionaire continues to unify some of his many business interests. 

SpaceX confirmed the deal to acquire xAI, a smaller firm known for its Grok chatbot, posting a memo from Musk about the merger on its website.

Terms of the deal were not disclosed. However, a source familiar said it valued xAI at $125bn (£91bn) and SpaceX at $1tn, making it the most valuable private company ever.

In his memo, Musk said the combination would form an ""innovation engine"" putting AI, rockets, space-based internet, and media under one roof. 

xAI began

 

as a segment of X, formerly known as Twitter, after Musk acquired the social media platform in 2022, using its access to real-time text and information as AI training data.

By spring of 2025, it was independently incorporated and valued more highly by investors than X.

Its main product is Grok, which has 

come under scrutiny several times

 over its AI image generation feature.

In recent weeks, the European Commission and UK watchdog Ofcom both launched investigations into X over concerns Grok was used to create sexualised images. 

xAI said in January it had imposed restrictions on Grok users that limit image editing.

Emma Wall, chief investment strategist at Hargreaves Lansdown, said Musk was the market leader in the ""two incredibly frontier technologies"" of AI and space exploration.

She said because the new merger is entirely private, it hasn't been tested by the market in the same way as Tesla, which is publicly listed.

""But what you're seeing priced in at these valuations is a kind of multi-decade vision for the company to put... energy and energy generation into space, data centres into space,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

However, Wall said any potential benefits would not be seen on earth for ""10, 20, 30 years"".

'Super company'

The huge merger comes after Musk's electric car company, Tesla, announced a $2bn investment in xAI last month.

Musk told Tesla investors that he envisioned xAI functioning as an ""orchestra conductor"" for Tesla factories employing autonomous robots.

He also said it would 

stop manufacturing

 two car models in favour of producing robots - one of the most significant pivots the company has made.

""It's those type of technologies that he'll be looking to leverage with this new kind of super company,"" Wall told the Today programme.

Reuters

Musk has said humanoid robots are central to Tesla's future as an AI market leader

Tesla moved forward with the xAI investment despite objections from some shareholders, who had questioned the decision to divert resources to another Musk firm. 

In a vote last year, abstentions and votes against the idea outnumbered those who approved.

SpaceX is also reported to be working on plans to list its shares for public trading.

Emily Zheng, a senior analyst at Pitchbook, said the deal for xAI has all the markings of a company preparing for a public listing. 

""The sheer cost of compute, infrastructure, and energy is why we are seeing many of venture's most valuable startups like SpaceX prepare to go public this year,"" Zheng said. 

""Consolidating these companies ahead of an IPO allows SpaceX to present a differentiated, capital-efficient growth narrative to public investors.""

IPO stands for Initial Public Offering, and this is when a private company first sells its stock to the public on a stock exchange.

Scaling ambitions

In the SpaceX memo announcing the xAI merger, Musk said he thought space would provide the solution to the energy needs faced by AI firms.

""In the long term, space-based AI is obviously the only way to scale,"" he wrote.

He said launching AI satellites from Earth would be the ""immediate focus"", but added that the deal would also help advance his bigger ambitions. 

""The capabilities we unlock by making space-based data centers a reality will fund and enable self-growing bases on the Moon, an entire civilization on Mars and ultimately expansion to the Universe,"" he wrote.

Neuralink and The Boring Company now appear to be the only two smaller Musk companies that have not been brought under one of his larger operations.

xAI acquired social media platform X in an all-stock deal 

last March

, with Musk saying the merger would ""combine the data, models, compute, distribution and talent"".

China has banned hidden door handles on electric vehicles (EVs), making it the first country to stop the use of the controversial designs that were made popular by multi-billionaire Elon Musk's Tesla.

It comes as EVs are facing scrutiny from safety watchdogs around the world after a number of deadly incidents, including two fatal crashes in China involving Xiaomi EVs in which power failures were suspected to have prevented doors from being opened.

Under the new regulations, cars will only be allowed to be sold if they have a mechanical release both on the inside and outside of their doors, according to state media. 

The new rules are due to take effect on 1 January 2027.

The Ministry of Industry and Information Technology rules require the outside of every passenger door except the boot, to have a recessed space measuring no smaller than 6cm (2 in) by 2cm by 2.5cm to allow access to the handle. 

Inside the car there must be signs measuring at least 1cm by 0.7cm to show how to open the door.  

Cars that have already been approved by authorities and are in the final stages of entering the Chinese market will have another two years to update their designs.

Hidden handles are widely used in China's new energy vehicle (NEV) market, which includes EVs as well as hybrid cars and those powered by fuel cells.

They feature in about 60% of the top 100 best-selling NEVs, according to data cited by government-controlled newspaper China Daily.

Although the measures will only apply to models sold in the Chinese market, the country's huge presence in the global car industry means the move is likely to have an impact around the world.

Tesla's door handles are already being investigated by US safety regulators and authorities in Europe are considering their own rules.

In November, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) opened a probe focused on Tesla's electric-powered door handles, responding to reports that they suddenly stopped working, leaving children trapped in the cars.

The NHTSA said it had received nine complaints about the handles in Tesla's 2021 Model Y cars, the company's flagship model.

In four of the cases, the car owners resorted to breaking the window to resolve the issue.

Representative image of a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner. The plane had flown from London to Bengaluru

India's aviation regulator said it found no defect in the fuel control switch of a Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner jet grounded by Air India based on a pilot's report.

The issue was reported on Sunday after the plane, which took off from London, landed in Indian's Bengaluru city.

The regulator said that while starting the engine during take-off, the crew noticed that twice the fuel control switch - which regulates the flow of fuel into the plane's engines - did not ""remain positively latched in the run position when light vertical pressure was applied"". 

It remained stable the third time and the crew closely monitored the aircraft during the flight, which ""was completed without incident"".

Air India had said in a statement on Monday that it informed India's aviation regulator about the issue and that it was getting the pilot's concerns checked on a ""priority basis"". A Boeing spokesperson had told the BBC in response to a question that the company was supporting Air India's ""review of this matter"".

The Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) said on Tuesday that when the switches were operated according to Boeing's recommended procedure, they were found to be ""satisfactory"", staying at run instead of moving to cut-off (which can stop fuel supply to the engines).

It added, however, that incorrectly handling the switch caused it to ""move easily from run to cut-off"".

These checks were performed in the presence of DGCA officials on the affected aircraft and another aircraft, the statement said. The DGCA has also asked Air India to circulate Boeing's recommended procedure to operate the switch to its crew members.  

The grounding of the plane gained a lot of attention as it came amid an ongoing investigation into last June's plane crash involving an Air India aircraft of the same model which killed 260 people.

The crash of the London-bound Air India Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner occurred less than a minute after the plane took off from Ahmedabad airport in western India. 

India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) is investigating the crash and a final report is expected to be released in a few months.

A preliminary report last July said that the plane's engines shut down after its fuel switches 

moved from the 'run' to the 'cut-off' position

 shortly after take-off, but did not establish how this had happened.

Air India crash plane had record of safety defects, campaigners claim

Why cockpit audio deepens the mystery of Air India crash

After the report was released, the US aviation regulator 

said that fuel control switches

 in Boeing airplanes were safe.

India's aviation regulator had also 

ordered an investigation

 of cockpit fuel switches in Boeing 787 and Boeing 737 aircraft operating in the country after the crash. Air India had said then that its inspections did not find any issue with the locking mechanism of the switch, which it reiterated on Monday.  

""Air India had checked the fuel control switches on all Boeing 787 aircraft in its fleet after a directive from the DGCA [Directorate General of Civil Aviation], and had found no issues,"" the airline said in the statement.

On Tuesday, Reuters news agency 

reported

 that Air India had begun re-checking the fuel switches on its Boeing Dreamliner aircraft following the incident flagged by the pilot.

Aviation consultant and former air accident investigator Tim Atkinson told the BBC that he trusted Boeing's design of the fuel control switches.

""These switches are designed with one purpose in mind, and that is that they cannot be moved unintentionally. There is no doubt in my mind that the design is good. I would be astonished to find it had some kind of latent defect,"" he said.

Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi (left) last met US President Donald Trump in February at the White House, but the two have spoken on the phone several times since then

US President Donald Trump's decision to lower reciprocal tariffs on India from 50% to 18% has been met with a sense of relief in Asia's third-largest economy, even as precise details on the agreement remain sketchy.

India paid the highest tariffs in the world after Trump raised import duties on Indian goods from 25% to 50% in August 

last year

, saying Delhi's purchase of discounted Russian oil was helping fund Moscow's war effort in Ukraine.

After his call with India's prime minister on Monday, Trump claimed Narendra Modi had ""agreed to stop buying Russian oil, and buy much more from the United States, and potentially Venezuela"".

India has not commented on these exact claims, but Modi thanked Trump ""on behalf of the 1.4 billion people of India for this wonderful announcement"", saying he hoped to take the partnership with the US to ""unprecedented heights"".

The patch-up comes after Trump's trade war soured carefully cultivated relations between Washington and Delhi, with exports from India to the US falling sharply across key job-creating sectors such as textiles, seafood and jewellery.

Trump's tariffs also forced a notoriously protectionist government in Delhi to expedite a flurry of other trade agreements and diversify its export markets.

Last week, India and the EU announced 

""the mother of all trade deals""

, eliminating tariff on 80-90% of goods. It was Delhi's ninth free trade agreement in four years, as the deal with Washington showed no signs of progress.

The long-delayed announcement by Trump was, as expected, widely welcomed by Indian industry.

""While the devil is in the details, it removes a hanging sword over the rupee, equity and rates market. Let us hope that it is a win-win deal for both the countries,"" said Nilesh Shah, a fund manager.

Exports from India to the US have sharply fallen across sectors such as seafood and textiles

Tariff-related uncertainty was one of the many reasons for India's rising trade gap, falling rupee and a flight of foreign money from the country last year. The 18% tariff now brings the rate in line with India's peers in Asia such as Vietnam, Thailand and Bangladesh who pay duties between 19% and 40% on US exports.

""This greatly boosts India's appeal as an alternative to China for the reconfiguration of supply chains. Indeed, India still offers many other advantages that other manufacturing hubs can't, including low labour costs, political stability and a large domestic market for MNCs to sell to as a hedge against future tariffs,"" Shilan Shah of Capital Economics said in a note.

India's textile exporters also cheered the announcement, with the Confederation of Indian Textile Industry saying the deal will allow them to ""compete effectively in the US market, the single-largest market for India's textile and apparel exports"".

'How will I pay workers?': Indian factories hit hard by Trump's 50% tariffs

But trade experts warn that there's much that's still in the realm of speculation, and Delhi should not rush to celebrate just yet.

""The Truth Social post [by Trump] leaves major questions unanswered - what products are covered, what the timelines are, and whether India has really agreed to zero tariffs and zero non-tariff barriers, especially in sensitive areas like agriculture and regulated imports,"" said Ajay Srivastava of the Delhi-based Global Trade and Research Initiative (GTRI) think-tank.

According to US Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins, under the deal, the US will ""export more American farm products to India's massive market, lifting prices, and pumping cash into rural America"", helping reduce the US's $1.3bn agricultural trade deficit with India. 

But Delhi has refrained from commenting on this politically sensitive issue. Greater access to farm produce was one of the biggest sticking points in the negotiations, given 50% of India's population depends on agriculture for their livelihoods. 

GTRI also cautioned against Trump's claims that Modi had committed to ""Buy American"" and purchase more than $500bn worth of energy, technology, agricultural and other goods, given that India's current annual imports from the US are under $50bn.

""Until there is a joint statement, negotiated text, and clarity on enforceability, this should be treated as a political signal - not a concluded trade deal. Caution, not celebration, is warranted,"" said Srivastava.

(From left) In September, Putin, Modi and Xi displayed clear bonhomie when they met in China for a summit

But the breakthrough in talks after a long impasse is being seen as directionally positive.

""Both governments have made clear that this is only the beginning, with additional phases and negotiations anticipated in the months ahead,"" the US-India Strategic Partnership Forum said in a statement, calling it an important first step.

From a geopolitical lens too, the announcement holds significance, say analysts.

Over the past year, Beijing, Delhi and Moscow had deepened ties after Trump's sweeping tariffs came into effect.

In August, China and India 

had pledged to be

 ""partners not rivals"".

In September, the leaders of India, China and Russia displayed rare solidarity at the 

Shanghai Co-operation Organisation Summit

 in Tianjin, smiling and posing for photographs in what was seen as clear signalling of a new bonhomie to the US administration.

And in December, Modi and Putin 

met again

, to further their ""no limits partnership"".

India's foreign policy has always had to juggle between these important relationships. But some reckon that the thawing of the relationship with Trump could now mean that Delhi leans back more quickly towards the US.

""Many in India would like to remain strategically unaligned, but if this rapprochement proves durable, India would likely gravitate back to the US bloc,"" said Shah.

Brian Leonard did not expect to be queueing outside of Hatton Garden Metals last week, but he was happy to wait anyway.

Like many others, he was at the family-run gold dealership in London to sell some precious metal - in his case a silver plate which had been ""lying around the house"".

Gold, silver, and platinum prices were near an all-time high when Brian was selling, 

but last Friday the bubble in the market burst and prices slumped

.

While precious metals remain much more valuable than this time last year, the frenzy shows how volatile commodities trading can be, with experts warning would-be sellers to be careful of being ripped off.

Gold and other precious metals are seen by many investors as a safe haven to store wealth in unstable economic times. This centuries old thinking is partly to do with how rare these metals are and how there is only a limited amount of them in the world.

Over the past year the price of gold soared alongside US President Donald Trump's attempts to take over Greenland and frantic trade policy. Previous surges have happened alongside the 1980 oil crisis, the 2008 financial crisis, and the 2020 Covid pandemic.

But the more recent slump in prices began late last week, after Trump made Kevin Warsh his pick for the chair of the Federal Reserve helped give investors some certainty. Deutsche Bank said this was ""the clear catalyst for Friday's sell-off"", which continued into Monday as prices fell further.

Other analysts have said it could simply have been a case of the market adjusting after precious metals' value shot up.

Due diligence and valuations

Gold and other precious metals trade in a very liquid market - that is to say, there are lots of people buying and selling all over the world at any given time. 

This means their prices can quickly change, as has happened over the last week. When markets move up and down like that, some people can end up selling too low or buying too high.

To avoid this, personal finance expert Fanny Snaith recommends doing due diligence and getting some no obligation free valuations rather than selling jewellery in response to ""just some advert"".

She also says sellers should consider the price of the jewellery might not just be the metal but the stones and design as well. This is why research and more than one valuation matters.

Financial advice charity 

National Debtline

 says anyone selling jewellery - or anything else - to pay off debt should make sure they own it first.

A person is not the owner of jewellery they are making payments for under a lease, rental, hire-purchase or bill of sale agreement. 

The charity says in some cases, a lender may agree to give you permission for a sale, but you wouldn't receive the full value of the item.

If a piece of jewellery is jointly owned by two people, the permission of both owners is usually needed in order to sell it.

The charity also recommends looking into different ways of selling jewellery to find the best way to sell the item.

The charity says it is important to consider the downsides to selling as well as the upsides.

The big upside is the ability to at least partially pay off creditors. But selling jewellery now, it points out, also means no longer having that asset for the future,  including retirement or as a family inheritance.

""If you have financial emergencies in the future, you may not have enough money or assets to deal with them,"" the charity adds.

Yellow is in, white is out

For jewellers on the ground, such as Harriet Kelsall, the founder of a bespoke jewellery business, the effect of all of this on items such as wedding rings has been ""complicated"".

On the one hand, she said she is seeing some customers reduce the amount of gold they are requesting in rings so they can pay the same price for the same style of ring.

Meanwhile, those who can afford to pay have gone in the other direction by looking to display what they have bought.

""Three years ago, everything we were making was white metal, people liked that low key, less bright yellow look. I think customers thought it was underplaying it.""

""And at the moment, it's reversed. Suddenly, we're seeing a big trend arriving for quite heavy, yellow-gold jewellery,"" she said.

One such owner of heavy gold jewellery is Brian Leonard. In his case, it's a watch he used to wear to work. 

He could have sold it last week at gold's peak, but he decided not to, keeping it as ""a memory of better days"". It's a reminder that not all jewellery can be valued in pounds and pence.

At the Singapore Airshow, the exhibition halls are lined with scale models, mock cockpits, and interactive displays showing the latest commercial jets and aviation technology.

One booth is drawing particular attention: Comac, China's state-owned planemaker, which has made significant strides since its C919 passenger jet flew to Singapore in its first trip outside of Chinese territory two years ago.

The plane is designed to compete with the Airbus A320neo and Boeing 737 MAX and is increasingly targeting markets beyond China.

In its own words ""Comac is setting sights on the Southeast Asian aviation market"".

For the company, the airshow is a chance to position itself as a potential rival to Airbus and Boeing in Asia-Pacific, the world's fastest-growing aviation market, at a time when airlines are grappling with delivery delays and stretched supply chains.

""I think in time, Comac will be a global competitor... but it's going to take them time,"" Willie Walsh, director general of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) told the BBC.

""I think 10 years, 15 years from now, we'll be talking about Boeing, Airbus and Comac... But without question, they will be a considerable player in the future.""

The Singapore Airshow is an influential trade show in the Asia Pacific region

There is certainly a need for another planemaker in Asia Pacific, analysts say.

Airlines in the region are feeling the strain from delivery delays at Boeing and Airbus, compounded by a shortage of engines and broader supply chain bottlenecks.

Uncertainty over tariffs and trade tensions has further complicated challenges for the manufacturing sector, affecting procurement and growth strategy in the region.

IATA data shows that global carriers are waiting longer than ever for new aircraft, pushing the average fleet age up and increasing operating costs because older planes are less fuel efficient.

Walsh said that Asia Pacific airlines could see double digit growth in 2026 if planes were available. ""It's incredibly frustrating for airlines. The wait between making an order and taking delivery is about seven years,"" he said.

This is why Comac is emerging as another option for many Asia Pacific airlines.

The company says it has delivered more than 200 C909 and C919 jets, with around a quarter of those planes being operated by airlines in Laos, Indonesia and Vietnam. Brunei's GallopAir has placed a large order for the firm's aircraft, and Cambodia is also planning to buy around 20 planes.

""We need more suppliers in the supply chain,"" said Subhas Menon, director general of the Association for Asia Pacific Airlines (AAPA). ""The problem with this industry is that the supply chain is an oligopoly and sometimes even a duopoly.""

""We have been waiting for this for a long time. Comac is a welcome introduction. We need more suppliers in the Asia Pacific especially.""

The company is in a good position with strong government support, and lower prices can make its aircraft appealing to budget airlines in emerging markets.

""In the future we welcome all newcomers. We are keen to see more competition. Comac has got its certification process to go through and at some point in the 2030s, we see that it will be an offering that would be attractive to ourselves and other carriers,"" Mike Szucs, chief executive of low-cost Philippines carrier Cebu Pacific told the BBC.

Airbus is showcasing its flagship A350-1000 high-capacity, long haul passenger jet

As well as expanding in Asia Pacific, Comac is also pursuing European certification, with regulators conducting test flights on its C919. This would allow it to sell to European carriers.

However, the road ahead remains long. 

European certification could take until 2028 or even 2031, regulators say. Meanwhile, harmonising a mix of Chinese and Western parts, flight controls, and software also presents technical challenges for international orders.

Maintenance and repair infrastructure is another hurdle, as is pilot training - areas where manufacturers like Boeing and Airbus have had infrastructure and systems set up for decades.

And in Asia Pacific, Comac has some competition beyond Boeing and Airbus.

Brazil's Embraer has carved out a foothold in the region with Singapore budget carrier Scoot, Virgin Australia and Japan's All Nippon Airlines (ANA) placing orders for Embraer jets.

Meanwhile, Boeing and Airbus still have a strong presence at the Singapore Airshow and the region as a whole. Both manufacturers are signalling to local carriers that aircraft delivery delays, which have frustrated airlines for years, are beginning to improve.

""We are pleased to say that we might be seeing light at the end of tunnel,"" Mike Szucs of Cebu Pacific said.

There are questions about Comac's order numbers, too. It has previously said it has more than 1,000 C919 passenger plane orders to Chinese airlines, but only a dozen have been delivered so far. 

And verifying these order numbers is difficult as Comac is a state-owned Chinese company not a publicly listed one like Boeing or Airbus.

Unless Comac can address some or all of these issues, Boeing and Airbus are likely to continue controlling the skies above Asia Pacific.

Like many high-end yachts, the Koru uses teak inside and for decking

Tech titan Jeff Bezos's $500m (£366m) superyacht, Koru, delivered in 2023, uses teak in its interior and for its decking.

The dense and heavy tropical hardwood is prized for its remarkable properties such as rot and salt resistance, as well as its beauty and as a symbol of status and prestige.

The highest quality teak comes from old-growth trees, which are harvested from natural forests almost exclusively in Myanmar.

But sold by the country's military-linked sector, with little regard for sustainability, the timber is illegal to import into the UK, EU and US.

Trade sanctions were imposed on the sector in 2021 following the coup there, though imports were already heavily restricted under longstanding laws.

Netherlands-based shipyard Oceanco, which built the Koru for Bezos, 

was fined in late 2024 by the authorities

 there for using Myanmar teak in the yacht's interior.

Whether the Koru's deck is also illegal Myanmar teak – or comes from legal plantations elsewhere – is under investigation in Germany, where the first importer of the deck's wood appears to have been based.

Another luxury yacht maker, UK-based Sunseeker, 

was also fined in late 2024

 for the use of Myanmar teak. Both Sunseeker and Oceanco have described their breaches as unintentional, with Sunseeker citing a lapse in due diligence.

Myanmar used to be the biggest supplier of teak

It is a well-known problem that Myanmar teak continues to find its way into supply chains, passed off for example as plantation teak from other tropical countries.

Alternatives to the wood in the yacht industry are gaining traction.

They range from thermally-modified woods, to fully synthetic materials, to engineered teak laminates – and while options have been around for years, recent innovations, say the companies and some users, are making them better.

While prosecutions doubtless have an impact, driving the trend to alternatives is the exhaustion of pre-sanctions stockpiles of old-growth timber.

Meanwhile, plantation teak from younger trees is widely seen by high-end shipyards as inferior, rarely coming in the long, wide, dark-brown boards associated with quality.

Other natural woods that could serve as teak substitutes often struggle to meet the industry's exacting standards or are limited in supply.

Cork is sometimes used. The fact that it is harvested from bark that can regrow rather than by felling trees makes it a sustainable, low-carbon choice proponents say, though its appearance doesn't appeal to everyone.

""Alternatives to natural teak are very welcome,"" says Walter Kollert, a Portugal-based forestry consultant and member of the steering committee of TEAKNET, a non-profit international teak information network.

""We are in danger of losing old-growth teak forests which are part of a valuable ecosystem,"" he says.

While the furniture and housing industries also use old-growth teak, they have generally found it easier to substitute plantation teak than the yachting industry, he adds.

Sunreef

Sunreef has switched from teak to alternative modified woods

Last October major luxury yacht maker Sunreef Yachts, based in Poland and Dubai, announced it was transitioning away from teak decking altogether.

""Teak is no longer an option anywhere in our range …[and] I believe we are the only ones to do this,"" says Nicolas Lapp, the company's co-founder and chief technical officer.

The decision, he says, was driven both by the difficulty of sourcing high quality plantation teak and the company's push for greater sustainability.

When you buy plantation teaks, you have a lot of wood that's just not usable, says Lapp.

After testing alternatives to teak, the company now offers two thermally-modified woods – in which a different natural wood is enhanced through heat to resemble teak – though it is not divulging publicly yet which those products are.

Meanwhile, some small boat models use a recyclable synthetic deck.

The thermally modified woods not only match teak's visual appeal but are easier to clean, and offer better thermal performance – staying cooler in the sun and insulating the cabins below, reducing the need for air conditioning, notes Lapp.

One newer, thermally-modified wood product on the market is Tesumo, launched by a company of the same name in late 2021.

The operation is small, but business is booming, says Arne Petersen, its managing director, adding it is working to increase output.

There have been some examples in the past of thermally-modified wood which haven't been successful which can cloud perceptions of newer materials, but Tesumo is a viable alternative, Petersen argues.

The product, made in Germany, emerged from a research project involving the University of Göttingen and Lürssen shipyard – one of the world's most prestigious yacht builders – after it struggled to find a good natural alternative to old-growth teak.

It starts with a fast-growing undisclosed African hardwood which is heat-treated and then further processed, including with resin impregnation.

High-profile installations so far include one of the helipads on the Lürssen-built superyacht Dragonfly, 

reportedly owned

 by Google co-founder Sergey Bryn, and the complete deck of Boardwalk, another Lürssen-built superyacht linked to US businessman Tilman Fertitta, owner of the Houston Rockets basketball team.

Flexiteek

Flexiteek is a plastic alternative to teak

Synthetic alternatives, including plastics, are also evolving. Among the earliest was Flexiteek, a UK-made PVC teak substitute introduced in 2000 and which is widely regarded as the market leader in its category.

In late 2024, the company launched its third-generation product.

It is easier to clean than real teak, retains its colour as teak greys over time, and has improved thermal performance compared to earlier versions says Steve Moore, the company's marketing manager.

Richard Strauss the CEO of Teakdecking Systems has experience of the challenges of sourcing teak.

Teakdecking Systems manufactured the decks for the Koru at its factory in Spain. Strauss says the teak used on the deck was purchased through a wood trader within the EU.

All the company's teak is ""purchased with validation of the chain of custody paperwork by a third party firm,"" he says.

The company fits decks using either plantation teak mostly sourced from India, or a small handful of alternatives it has had good success with. That includes a laminated wood product, Green Teak, which comes from Thailand.

Laminated teak is an engineered product in which plantation-grown teak, that would normally be rejected for high-end decking, is thinly sliced and glued together to form a strong, stable material.

""You are kind of tricking the eye…[and in the process] using far more of the log,"" says Strauss.

Meanwhile old habits die hard. Strauss notes that plantation teak is still the most popular among his customers.

Lapp of Sunreef says what's really needed is a wider culture shift away from teak altogether.

Customers typically start with wanting teak until they learn the problem and that alternatives can offer benefits.

""Then we show them… and they realise they can't tell the difference,"" says Lapp.

However, small UK family yacht building business Jeremy Rogers is sticking with teak for now – sourced from older government-managed plantations in Java that it is confident are authentic and harvested sustainably.

The firm is keen to adopt a genuinely sustainable substitute that performs well, but its past experiments with alternatives have mostly fallen short, says Jessie Rogers.

""The problem for the alternatives is there is nothing quite like real teak,"" she says.

Correction 4 February: This article was amended to provide further details about Teakdecking Systems' role in making the teak deck for the Koru which were not included in an earlier version.

Rain drifts across the car park of Crawley's sprawling Asda, but the gloom does little to slow the steady stream of shoppers this midweek afternoon. Parents hurry past with school bags and groceries; car boots slam shut as people load up their weekly shops.

For Carol Stimpson, who grew up in the area, the Asda is only a ten‑minute walk from her home, and she pops in most days. ""It's my corner shop,"" she says.

Joanne Dench, another local, is also shopping in Crawley, and says she visits the town's Asda for its variety. ""They've got a good range of stuff — clothes, all sorts of things... And they have lots of international food, which is lovely because I like trying new things.""

But despite the bustle in this West Sussex Asda, the chain has been losing ground to rivals at an alarming rate.

Joanne Dench, shopping in the centre of Crawley, says she enjoys Asda's range

The UK's third-biggest supermarket had a dreadful Christmas. Two sets of industry data show Asda suffered a big slump in sales while all its main rivals reported an increase.

Asda's sales decreased by 4.2%, during the 12 weeks to 28 December 2025, according to Worldpanel — and that's off the back of a terrible Christmas the year before.

""A mess"" is how William Woods, a food retail analyst from Bernstein Research, describes Asda's situation.

The industry data suggests that despite Asda embarking on a turnaround and cutting prices, shoppers are still turning away. Asda's hope is that with time the plan will work out, but the question others are asking is whether this 60-year-old retailer is really able to turn things around.

A controversial deal

For decades, Asda had the reputation as Britain's cheapest grocer, a slightly cheeky northern-based business loved by families for its ""everyday low prices.""

A generation grew up with its ""That's Asda Price"" TV commercial, first featured in an advert for the supermarket in 1977, showing shoppers tapping their back pockets signalling they'd saved money at the tills.

The business was sold to the US retail giant Walmart in 1999, in what was then the largest foreign takeover in the UK retail sector.

But from about 2010, Asda struggled to fend off the growing threat from Aldi and Lidl as Walmart's global priorities focused on its businesses in the US and elsewhere.

In 2021 it sold the chain. In the four years leading up to the transaction, Asda paid just over £4bn to Walmart through a series of dividend payments.

Asda was bought by two billionaire brothers from Blackburn and the private equity firm TDR Capital for £6.8bn.

Mohsin and Zuber Issa made their fortune by building a petrol forecourt empire, EG Group. They were hailed as self-made entrepreneurs who would inject fresh thinking.

Asda's sales decreased by 4.2%, during the 12 weeks to 28 December 2025, according to Worldpanel

But the sale was financed by adding billions of pounds worth of debt onto Asda's business — one of the UK's biggest debt-funded takeovers in recent history.

It was a controversial deal inked at the end of a Covid boom in groceries, when people were spending much more time at home and less money eating out. But the market soon changed. The war in Ukraine triggered a huge rise in inflation and a new era of rising interest rates, pushing up the cost of Asda's borrowings.

Asda's market share

Following the takeover, Asda's CEO left, and Mohsin Issa took over the reins.

""His instincts were good, but it needed an experienced figure to guide the business through the very choppy waters,"" says one former Asda executive.

The problems grew, compounded by high management turnover and shifting priorities.

Store standards fell after cuts in staff hours and shoppers complained about empty shelves, slow restocking, and poor online availability.

Lynette from Swindon first started shopping at Asda more than 20 years ago, but says it began to go ""downhill"" really quickly — ""you could see it in the supermarket, half the tills were closed, shelves were empty.""

Once a loyal Asda shopper, she has within the last few years begun using the discounters Aldi and Lidl for her main shopping.

EG Group

Following the takeover, Mohsin Issa took over the reins

Behind the scenes, Asda was also working through a huge tech overhaul as it moved away from the systems it used under Walmart.

This included installing close to 16,500 new checkouts and launching a new groceries app and website — costing hundreds of millions of pounds.

By autumn 2024, Mohsin Issa had stood down from his role. TDR also took majority ownership of the business, putting them in the driving seat.

Asda's market share stood at 14.3% just before the takeover, according to Worldpanel, at the end of December 2025, it had fallen to 11.4%.

Comparing this to the value of the grocery market overall, you end up with a business that is £4.5bn smaller in terms of annual revenue, at today's prices, than it would have been if Asda had maintained this share, according to Worldpanel sales analysis.

Grocers have high fixed costs and slim profit margins. If you can grow the amount of stuff you sell, your profits can increase quickly, but the reverse can happen if your volumes decline (you sell fewer products in total) — leading to ""a negative spiral which is really, really difficult to get out of,"" says Bernstein's William Woods.

The revival of Asda

Asda is now in the midst of a turnaround plan.

But, judging by the industry data, there's been little sign of traction. The question is, does it simply need more time, or will it be unable to win customers back?

The company has brought in the man who helped rescue Asda from the brink of collapse some thirty years earlier, to revive its fortunes.

Allan Leighton was appointed executive chair in November 2024, then aged 71. His big plan? The revival of Asda Rollback, the price campaign which he deployed, successfully, in the '90s.

""Rollbacks"" are temporary price reductions. This time round, after the Rollback ends, the products are then moved to a new ""Asda Price"" which are ""guaranteed"" to be lower than the original pre-Rollback price.

Leighton said his aim was to make Asda 5-10% cheaper than other traditional supermarkets by the end of 2026, and he was prepared to take a big hit on profits, in the short term, to achieve it.

One year on from its launch, Asda's pricing has improved. Data provided to the BBC by retail research firm Assosia shows that Asda's prices on more than 30 branded items were mostly cheaper than Tesco, Sainsbury's and Morrisons based on promotional deals over the festive quarter.

The retailer has also regularly come top of a closely watched weekly price survey run by The Grocer magazine. It doesn't include Aldi and Lidl.

""At times in the last year, Asda has certainly been 5% cheaper than all its established rivals,"" says Adam Leyland, editor-in-chief of The Grocer.

The trouble is, the price cuts don't appear to have made any difference.

""For shoppers, it's not just about price,"" says Leyland. Customer service, in-store experience and range is also important as well as perception about ""value"" and brand appeal.

That sentiment is echoed by Madeline in Crawley. She says she avoids doing her weekly shop at the town's Asda.

""A lot of the shelves are quite empty, and there are always trolleys in the aisles when they're filling up shelves. Sometimes you can't get to where you want to be — it puts you off.""

One key supplier I spoke to said Asda needed to strike a better balance by investing more in stores and availability, and getting a grip on ""the basic fundamentals of retailing"".

Asda has put more staff in stores and insists it is making progress.

But once you've lost shoppers, it's very hard to win them back, especially when many of your rivals are firing on all cylinders, helped by price matching and loyalty schemes, in an intensely competitive market.

William Woods believes Asda should have stuck to its year-long Aldi and Lidl price match campaign, which ended in January 2025. He says price matching has been a ""great psychological mechanism"" for Tesco and Sainsbury's to change customer perception and fight the discounters.

Their respective loyalty price schemes, Clubcard and Nectar, also create a ""wow"" factor at the till, Woods says.

Asda points out that rebuilding the business is a three to five year journey.

""We are in the early stages of our transformation,"" a spokesperson said. ""This is anchored in offering an unmatched value proposition, making sure products are always available and ensuring customers have the best possible experience when visiting our stores or shopping online.

""This approach is beginning to be reflected in stronger volumes over recent periods.""

One person familiar with the situation said there had been signs of a recovery last summer, but that coincided with the final stage of Asda's separation from Walmart's systems. This caused disruption, leading to empty shelves in the all important run up to Christmas trading, a ""nightmare"" putting the turnaround six months behind schedule, they said.

""It's annoying, disappointing, but we had to get out of the Walmart system.""

Does Asda have the firepower?

In December, Asda registered its 22nd consecutive month of decline, according to Worldpanel sales data.

Many in the industry are wondering if it has the necessary firepower to regain all the lost ground. Even if it can fix the basics, will Asda's high levels of debt prevent a full recovery?

It sold off a raft of stores and a distribution centre – and then rented them back – to help reduce its borrowings. At the end of December 2024, its net debt stood at £3.8bn, whilst the annual financing costs, including debt interest payments, increased 38% to £611m.

""It's an amazing brand….  but sadly, I believe the business is totally broken,"" the former Asda executive believes.

""Whoever the owner is, I just don't think the business can stomach, or the balance sheet can't stomach, the level of investment that is required. The lack of investment goes back 10-15 years,"" they claimed.

Getty Images

In December, Asda registered its 22nd consecutive month of decline, according to Worldpanel sales data

An Asda spokesperson said its ""strong balance sheet and underlying free cash flow generation"" means it can comfortably cover current and future debt obligations.

Like Asda, Morrisons has also been struggling under new private equity owners and has been selling assets to reduce its debt pile. It has lost all important market share and the number four spot to Aldi but its performance has recently stabilised.

According to the major supplier, both businesses are in a race to get out of the debt burden, which is holding them back.

""I would love for them [Asda] to get back to where they were. Whether it's feasible is another question..."" the supplier says.

Ged Futter spent fifteen years working as a buyer for Asda. He now runs a business training suppliers on how to negotiate with supermarkets and fears his former employer is in ""real trouble"".

""I was with a client today who said Asda was asking for this investment for promotions. The client said I'm walking away. What they asked for is too much. I'm backing another horse.""

2026: Make or break

This year there's also been a further fall in the price of Asda's traded debt — a sign that investors are getting more nervous about the viability of the turnaround.

The person familiar with the workings of Asda says they believe it has a compelling offer with its in store pharmacies and opticians, as well as the George clothing brand and a general merchandise business that is healthy.

The view among many observers I've spoken to is that some form of consolidation in the sector seems, at some point,  inevitable — whether that means supermarkets breaking up, being sold, or merging.

Allan Leighton has compared his task to climbing Mount Everest. Certainly, winning back customers will be no mean feat.

Swindon local Lynette says: ""I don't think I will ever go back to shopping at Asda again, I might pick up the odd thing there, but they've lost me as a loyal customer.""

Asda badly needs some momentum, and 2026 feels make or break for the turnaround.

The budget presented on Sunday focuses on fiscal restraint after a slew of tax giveaways last year

India's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman has presented her annual budget for 2026-27, announcing higher infrastructure spending and measures to support domestic manufacturing amid rising global uncertainties.

India is expected to close this financial year with 7.4% gross domestic product (GDP) growth according to the country's Economic Survey, but economic expansion will slow slightly next year as US President Donald Trump's 50% tariffs on Indian exporters start taking a greater toll.

The budget has laid a strong emphasis on fiscal restraint, targeting a lower deficit for the upcoming financial year. The fiscal deficit is the gap between the government's total expenditure and its total revenue.

Here are five key takeaways from the budget announcements:

Record infrastructure spending, higher defence outlays

Infrastructure such as road, port and railway projects has been a mainstay focus of the Narendra Modi government for the past decade, and this budget continues to expand allocations to these sectors. 

The capital spending target for the upcoming financial year beginning 1 April has gone up some 9% to 12.2tn rupees ($133.1bn; £105bn) from 11.1tn rupees.

Outlays for defence have also jumped by over 20% in the backdrop of heightened geopolitical tensions globally. 

Hindustan Times via Getty Images

The budget has continued to lay emphasis on infrastructure-led capital expenditure

Manufacturing push in strategic sectors like rare earths, semiconductors

The government has proposed to scale up manufacturing in seven strategic sectors including semiconductors, data centres, textiles and rare earths, amid 

slowing private investments 

and a flight of foreign capital from India. 

Sitharaman announced that dedicated corridors will be set up for rare earth minerals in four states, including Tamil Nadu, Kerala and Andhra Pradesh in the south and Odisha in the east. The announcement follows India's approval of a 73bn-rupee 

rare earths scheme

 unveiled in November.

The budget also launched a second semiconductor mission with an outlay of $436m to produce equipment and materials and design full-stack intellectual property.

India is also proposing a tax holiday up to 2047 for foreign cloud companies making data-centre investments in the country and providing cloud services to customers globally. India has been attracting billions of dollars of 

data centre investments

 with the likes of Google last year announcing a $15bn investment in a facility in southern India.

This provides ""long-term fiscal certainty for a highly capital-intensive sector, significantly improving investment viability and accelerating capacity creation"", said Ritika Loganey Gupta of Ernst & Young India.

The budget has also announced new mega-textiles parks to enhance India's exports competitiveness in the labour-intensive garments industry - expected to benefit from greater global market access following last week's 

India-EU free trade agreement

.

No new tax giveaways

Amid slowing exports because of US tariffs, India has proposed raising limits on duty-free inputs for industries such as seafood, which are major export sectors. Customs duty exemptions have also been allowed for inputs used to manufacture lithium-ion batteries.

But no direct tax cuts have been announced on personal incomes. This was expected as Modi's government had 

raised income tax exemption limits

 last year, making earnings of up to 1.2m rupees - excluding special rate income like capital gains - entirely tax-free. There was also a rationalisation of the 

goods and services tax (GST)

, leaving little fiscal room for fresh cuts.

Fiscal restraint

Starting April 2026, the government has shifted from targeting a rigid yearly fiscal deficit - the gap between revenue and expenditure - to focusing on the overall debt-to-GDP ratio, which is a country's total government debt to the size of the economy.

The government now aims to bring down this ratio from 56% to 50% (+/-1%) by 2030-31 - this will give Delhi more flexibility to spend on higher capital expenditure and adapt its spending needs more effectively, according to economists.

The debt-to-GDP ratio for the upcoming financial year is estimated to ease to 55.6%, and the fiscal deficit estimated to come down from 4.4% to 4.3% of GDP.

The markets plunged because of a hike in the Security Transaction Tax 

Markets disappointed

Despite strong signalling on fiscal discipline, the financial markets, which were open in special trading on Sunday because of the budget, fell sharply as the Securities Transaction Tax (STT) on futures and options trading was raised. 

""Coming on top of last year's hike, this is likely to raise impact costs for traders, hedgers and arbitrageurs. This could cool derivative activity and lead to a reduction in volumes,"" said Shripal Shah, managing director and CEO of Kotak Securities.

Ineos Energy

The Siri platform is the hub for the Greensand Future project

""Prepare for an offshore landing,"" the pilot announces, before landing on a platform 250km (155 miles) from Denmark's west coast.

The helicopter has just circled around Nini, a nearby rig rising up from the choppy waters of the North Sea.

The rig sits over an almost-depleted oilfield that's about to get a second life as a massive carbon storage project called Greensand Future.

The plan is to pump thousands of tonnes of climate-warming CO2 into the old oil field.

We step on to Siri, a larger ""mother platform"" that has a control centre manned by offshore workers. 

Mads Gade, CEO of Ineos Energy points to the huge pipes of the wellhead which, for decades, carried oil and gas up from below the seabed.

""Instead of pulling the oil and gas up from the ground, we're going to inject the CO2 into the ground instead,"" he says.

Ineos Energy

Mads Gade runs Ineos Energy which is leading the consortium behind Greensand Future

Carbon Capture and Storage technology (CCS), involves capturing and permanently storing carbon dioxide.

Greensands Future, which is backed by a consortium led by British multinational chemicals company Ineos, will become the EU's first large-scale offshore CO2 storage site, when commercial operations get underway in the next few months.

The plan is to stash away around 400,000 tonnes of CO2 this year, potentially rising to eight million tonnes annually by 2030, the company claims. 

""That's almost 40% of the Danish emission reduction target. So that's quite impactful,"" says Gade.

Both the UN's top climate science body, the 

Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change

 (IPCC), and the 

International Energy Agency

 (IEA), have said that, in addition to deep and rapid emissions cuts, technologies to capture and remove carbon are important tools to help limit global warming.

Meanwhile, the EU 

says CCS is necessary

 to achieve the goal of ""net zero"" emissions by 2050.

However, CCS technology is not without critics, who warn it might discourage efforts to cut CO2 emissions.

It's also expensive and some environmental groups argue that emission reductions can be achieved at a lower cost, using more existing technology such as wind power, solar, and electric cars.

""I don't mind CCS on those sectors where emissions are truly hard-to-abate or impossible-to-abate,"" says Helene Hagel, head of climate and environmental policy at Greenpeace Denmark.

""But there are also places where it makes no sense at all,"" she says.

Hagel argues that we could also be making problems for the future.

""If our generation, uses the seabed for storing carbon that we shouldn't have emitted in the first place, then the generations coming after us won't be able to use the seabed to store their emissions.""

North Sea oil and gas facilities can be re-used for carbon storage

Globally, hundreds of CCS initiatives are underway or in development.

In Europe, several very large-scale projects are advancing in the North Sea region, particularly in Norway, the Netherlands, Denmark and UK.

Billed as the world's first commercial carbon storage service, last August, Norway's Northern Lights project, began storing CO2 under the seabed off Bergen.

In the UK, a number of carbon capture clusters are under development, including Scotland's Acorn Project and the Viking project off Lincolnshire.

One reason the North Sea is emerging as a CCS hub, is its oil and gas legacy. After decades of production, the geology of potential storage sites is well explored, says Niels Schovsbo, a senior researcher at the Geological Survey of Greenland and Denmark (GEUS).

There's also existing offshore infrastructure and technical know-how. That's one reason his firm is among the first-movers, says Gade.

""[Nini]'s coming to the end of its lifetime,"" he says.

""Instead of dismantling everything, we can actually reuse the facilities, the skills, the competencies we have.""

The North Sea's geology is well suited to CO2 storage says Niels Schovsbo

Inside a large warehouse on the outskirts of Copenhagen, cases of rock samples are stacked floor to ceiling.

Schovsbo, opens a box to show me a grainy green slab drilled from the seafloor.

The geology in this area of the North Sea is well-suited for CO2 storage, says Schovsbo. The rock has a large number of pores, or small cavities, that can hold the CO2.

An almost kilometre thick layer of clay or cap rock will lock away the CO2, just as it trapped oil and gas for millions of years, Schovsbo explains.

""It's the same sealing mechanism,"" he says.

A comparable amount of CO2 can be stored, to the volume of oil and gas that's been extracted, he added, suggesting an operational lifespan for CCS sites of 10 to 30 years.

For the region's many offshore workers, carbon storage opens up new opportunities. 

""A lot of the work we're doing today by maintaining turbines and gas compressors will be shifted to maintaining high pressure pumps that inject the CO2,""  maintenance manager, Peter Bjerre told the BBC.

The Esbjerg local adds, ""Fifty years back, it was fishing we made money off, then going into oil and gas,"" he says.

""It is just amazing seeing a future building up here with the green transition here.""

Kevin Warsh has previously worked at the Federal Reserve and on Wall Street

Donald Trump has been calling for change at the US central bank. 

Now, with Jerome Powell's term as Federal Reserve chairman poised to end in May, he could be about to get his wish.

On Friday, the US president announced Kevin Warsh - a conservative whom he had passed over for the post, to his regret, during his first term - as his choice to replace Powell. 

""Warsh ""is 'central casting' and he will never let you down,"" Trump declared on social media as he announced the decision. 

The irony of the choice was lost on no one. Warsh has made his name as a supporter of higher interest rates - a reputation he has tried to shed in recent opinion articles and media appearances. 

It's a position that would seem to put him at odds with Trump, a self-described ""low interest rate guy"", who has criticised Powell for not cutting interest rates quickly enough and who has made no secret that his choice to lead the Fed should be on board with his views.

It remains to be seen whether Warsh's selection will lead to the bank Trump wants.

Warsh brings a traditional background to the job: an Ivy League education, a prior stint at the Fed, as well as time on Wall Street and at the Hoover Institution - a conservative economic think tank.

Supporters say he is sensitive to concerns about the bank's independence and alert to the risks if its policies serve short-term political aims rather than the wider economy.

Lee Ohanian, an economics professor at UCLA and senior fellow at the right-leaning Hoover Institution, who has known Warsh for years, said taking directions from Trump ""would diminish the Fed. It would diminish the office of the chairman, and it would create tremendous turmoil in the financial markets. Kevin knows that"". 

In Congress and on Wall Street, 

where Trump's attacks on Powell have caused alarm,

 Warsh's potential independent streak is seen as a plus.

His nomination has drawn praise from establishment figures including former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice, and Mohamed el-Erian, a high-profile economist with a long career on Wall Street.

Critics have questioned whether it is the fact that Warsh's father-in-law, Ronald Lauder, is a Trump donor and friend that got him the job. 

Others say his record as a policymaker is poor, noting that Warsh opposed economic stimulus during the 2008 financial crisis as he fretted the policies would lead to inflation – a minority view then and now.  

Congressman Don Beyer, a Democrat from Virginia, accused Warsh of showing ""willingness to wildly alter his views...based on who is in the White House"".

But on balance, many in financial circles see him as a responsible pick. 

""There appears to be at least some degree of comfort with a Warsh-led Fed vs. the other choices,"" Wells Fargo analysts said on Friday - noting that his relatively sparse public profile in recent years implies a degree of uncertainty. 

""Investors should be thankful,"" Jeffrey Roach, chief economist for LPL Financial, told the BBC.

What Warsh could mean for interest rates?

The acceptance of Warsh is partially a gamble that a Fed with him in charge might not change much. 

After all, despite Trump's complaints, the Fed cut interest rates three times last year and most analysts expect additional cuts this year – regardless of what Trump thinks.

That's good news for borrowers in the US, who may see lower rates on mortgages, car loans and other kinds of debt - and maybe for the president too, if this makes people feel better about the economy. 

It also means Warsh does not necessarily have to surrender his credibility as an independent economist to deliver lower interest rates for Trump. 

'Mission creep' at the Fed

Where differences might be felt more is in other parts of the Fed, which Warsh has accused of ""

mission creep

"" and taking on too big a role in the economy. 

He wants to reduce its role in bank regulation and cut back study of issues like climate change - putting him in alignment with the White House. 

He, like Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, is a fierce critic of the interventions the Fed made in markets after the 2008 financial crisis and again during the Covid-19 pandemic, which has left the bank with huge holdings of Treasuries and mortgage-backed securities. 

Warsh maintains these policies prop up the stock market and other assets - benefiting the wealthy and big financial interests rather than the mainstream economy - and has called for reducing those holdings and coordinating their management more closely with the Treasury Department.

Whether he would actually lead the Fed to shrink its balance sheet more quickly than the bank has been doing is unclear. One effect of doing so could be higher borrowing costs - exactly the opposite of what Trump wants to see. 

On Friday, gold prices dropped and the dollar gained, suggesting traders see Warsh as likely to stick to his initial instincts as a ""hawk"" who favours higher interest rates. 

Narayana Kocherlakota, a finance professor at the University of Rochester, who served on the Fed with Warsh, said he thinks he would go against the president if conditions called for it. 

""He's very smart and he's very independent. And I think that's the kind of person that Americans should want at the head of their central bank,"" Kocherlakota said. 

Others argue Warsh's thinking on the economy has evolved to be closely aligned with Trump, including downplaying concerns that rapid growth and rising wages could fuel inflation. 

""Warsh is not the Fed's guy, he is Trump's guy, and has shadowed Trump on monetary policy almost every step of the way since 2009,"" wrote Thierry Wizman, global foreign exchange and rates strategist at Macquarie Group. 

For now, Warsh may look like the candidate most likely to satisfy all parties. 

But Trump's swift turn on Powell - his last pick for Fed chair - should serve as a cautionary reminder.

Studies show that we spend more in a fast-food restaurant when we order from a touchscreen

On an industrial estate on the outskirts of Birkenhead on Merseyside, an English company is helping to shape the future of shopping.

These are the offices of Evoke Creative, which makes self-service terminals, the sort of things you see popping up everywhere from McDonald's to your local library.

One of the reasons those large touchscreens, also called kiosks, have become so popular with restaurant chains is that they can significantly increase sales.

And that is down to behavioural science, the study of how humans behave, and what drives people to make the choices that they do.

Dean Ward is the founder and chief product officer at Evoke Creative. Among the companies his business has built terminals for are Travelodge, McDonalds and JD Sports.

He says there's a number of reasons why the machines drive sales. ""Firstly, you are removing the psychology of speaking to someone and feeling judged, we think that is a key factor,"" says Ward.

""Would you like extra fries? Would you like to go large? Not all people, but I think there's definitely a large proportion of people who may feel judged in those instances, and may say no.

""Plus, there's really good product imagery on the terminals, so you can see the product, you can see what's in it, you can see all the other products linked to it as well. So there's that.

""And also around upsell. At every opportunity within the customer journey on the terminal, you are asked would you like to add this, would you like to do that? Because you've got more time and you're not being judged, you're very much more inclined to actually say yes to these things.""

Evoke Creative

Dean Ward's firm has made self-service terminals for a number of the biggest restaurant chains

The data backs up what Ward says. Some 61% of customers spend more at a terminal than a till, 

according to another provider

 of the technology, Vita Mojo. The London-based firm's clients include fast-food chains Leon and Honest Burgers.

The increased amount that people spend per order is said to be as much as 40%.

Before it was even known as behavioural science, companies were using the psychological tools it taps into to shape our choices.

Back in the 1940s, the US tobacco company RJ Reynolds ran a famous cigarette campaign lauding the fact that ""more doctors smoke Camels than any other cigarette"".

Today you can see echoes of that campaign in ads for toothpaste, with dentists recommending a particular brand.

Ben Jones is from UK and Australia-based business consultancy The Behavioural Architects, which looks at behavioural science and how it can be used by companies.

He says that in both the tobacco and toothpaste examples, the firms were tapping into something known in behavioural science as ""authority bias"".

""Authority bias is the tendency we have to align our opinions, or our behaviours, with someone we see as an authority or an expert on something. When we're unsure, we don't know what to do, it's kind of easy to follow the lead of those who we think are credible or knowledgeable.

""Some businesses can draw on this through things like endorsements. dentists recommending toothpaste, athletes endorsing sportswear, nutritionists with food.""

AFP via Getty Images

Toothpaste brands have cited how they are recommended by dentists

If RJ Reynolds were amongst the first to use behavioural science techniques, now everyone from big brands to the United Nations (UN) is getting in on the act.

In the UK 

one of the most successful

 applications of behavioural science has been the introduction of auto-enrolment in work pensions from 2012. It's led to more than 10 million more people in the UK saving for a pension than before it was introduced.

The reason it has massively increased pension take up is what's known in behavioural science as ""default bias"". If you've never changed the ringtone on your phone, or your computer wallpaper. That's default bias in action too.

""Generally, it's our tendency to go with the option that's already selected, or the option that's already presented to us as the default setting,"" says Jones. ""We make thousands of decisions every single day, and defaults are one of those things that just helps us manage that overload of choices we're always having to make.

""They let us act quickly. And one of the big success stories for defaults is the automatic enrolment in pension schemes, because many of us procrastinate saving for retirement. And the default really helps overcome the inertia we have and supports a positive long-term outcome.""

BBC Business Daily: Why you buy what you buy

Behavioural science can also impact your choice on more sinful things too. For example, your choice of wine. It may sound like an urban myth, but there's real science behind it.

In 

one experiment,

 Adrian North and his colleagues at Leicester University alternated the music in a supermarket between French accordion and German oompah tunes.

On the days French music was played, French wine sales dominated, on German music days the German wine sold far better. But the effect was subconscious. When asked, customers weren't even aware of the effect, but the numbers were clear.

One study found that a supermarket sold more French wine when it played French music

The World Food Programme (WFP), part of the United Nations (UN), provides food aid and advice where needed around the world.

In Tunisia the WFP worked with the marketing giant Ogilvy to create a TV drama called Salla Salla, which aired last year.

They 

used behavioural science

 to help shape the script, with the aim of getting messages around healthy eating and food waste across in a way that was palatable to viewers.

""We tried to use some innovation and some creativity to change behaviours,"" says Takwa Khelifi from the WFP. 

""Because, if you know the facts only, it doesn't change people and doesn't change behaviour. We all know better, but we don't do better.""

The show was the fourth most-watched on Tunisian TV when it was broadcast. It led to a 22% drop in bread consumption.

Brands, governments, the UN. They're all using behavioural science to help shape your choices in ways you might not have previously been aware.

Tejas Networks

Tejas Networks supplies equipment for mobile phone networks and broadband connections

A reliable supply of computer chips is essential for Arnob Roy, the co-founder of Tejas Networks.

His company, based in Bangalore, India, supplies the equipment behind mobile phone networks and broadband connections.

""Essentially, we provide the electronics that carry traffic across telecom networks,"" he says.

That requires special chips designed for telecoms tasks.

""Telecom chips are fundamentally different from consumer or smartphone chips. They handle massive volumes of data coming simultaneously from hundreds of thousands of users.

""These networks cannot go down. Reliability, redundancy and fail-safe operation are critical - the chip architecture has to support that,"" Roy says.

Tejas designs many of those chips in India, a country well known for its expertise in designing computer chips (also known as semiconductors).

It's estimated that 20% of the world's semiconductor engineers are in India.

""Almost every major global chip company has its largest or second-largest design centre in India, working on cutting-edge products,"" says Amitesh Kumar Sinha, Joint Secretary of India's Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology.

What India lacks is companies that manufacture semiconductors.

So Indian firms like Tejas Neworks design the chips they need in India, but then have them manufactured overseas.

The weakness of that system 

was exposed during Covid

, when the supply of chips dried up and companies in all sorts of industries had to scale back production. 

""The pandemic made it clear that semiconductor manufacturing is too concentrated globally, and that concentration carries serious risk,"" Roy says.

That spurred India to develop its own semiconductor industry.

""Covid showed us how fragile global supply chains can be. If one part of the world shuts down, electronics manufacturing everywhere is disrupted,"" says Sinha.

""That's why India is developing its own semiconductor ecosystem to reduce risk and increase resilience,"" he adds.

He is leading government efforts to develop the semiconductor industry, which involves identifying parts of the production process where India can compete.

Computer chips are made by etching circuits on to silicon wafers

There are 

several steps in making a computer chip

. First design, where India is already strong.

The second stage is wafer fabrication, where thin sheets of silicon have circuits etched on to them by extremely expensive machines in huge factories known as semiconductor ""fabs"".

That part of the process, particularly for the most sophisticated chips, is dominated by companies in Taiwan, with China trying to catch up.

In the third stage those large silicon wafers are sliced up into individual chips, packaged in protective casing, connected to contacts and tested.

That third stage, known as Outsourced Semiconductor Assembly and Test (Osat), is the part of the production process targeted by India. 

""Assembly, test and packaging are easier to start than fabs and that is where India is moving first,"" says Ashok Chandak, president of India Electronics and Semiconductor Association (IESA).

He says that several such plants will ""enter mass production"" this year.

Getty Images

China is building up its semiconductor industry

Founded in 2023, Kaynes Semicon is the first company to get a semiconductor plant up and running with support from the Indian government.

Kaynes Semicon invested $260m (£270m) in a factory to assemble and test computer chips in the northwestern state of Gujarat. Production started in November of last year. 

""Packaging is not just putting a chip in a box. It's a 10 to 12 step manufacturing process,"" says Raghu Panicker, CEO of Kaynes Semicon.

""That's why packaging and testing are as critical as making the chip itself without this stage, the wafer is useless to industry."" 

His facility will not be making the most advanced computer chips found in the latest mobile phones or used for training AI.

""India does not need the most complex datacentre or AI chips on day one. That is not where our demand is, and that is not where our strength lies today,"" Panicker says.

Instead, they will be the kind of chips used in cars, telecoms and the defence industry. 

""These are not glamorous chips, but they are economically and strategically far more important for India.  You build an industry by first serving your own market. Complexity can come later. Scale has to come first,"" he adds.

It's been a steep learning curve for Kaynes Semicon.

""We had never built a semiconductor cleanroom in India before. We had never installed this equipment before. We had never trained people for this before,"" Panicker says.

""Semiconductors demand a level of discipline, documentation and process control that is very different from traditional manufacturing. That cultural shift is as important as the technical one.""

Getting staff trained has been a huge challenge.

""Training takes time. You cannot shortcut five years of experience into six months. That is the single biggest bottleneck,"" Panicker says.

Back in Bangalore, at Tejas Networks, Arnob Roy is looking forward to buying more locally-sourced tech.

""Over the next decade, we expect a significant semiconductor manufacturing base to emerge in India and that will directly help companies like ours.""

It's the start of a long journey, he says.

""I do see Indian companies eventually designing and manufacturing complete telecom chipsets but it will take patient capital and time.

""Deep-tech products take longer to mature, and India is only now beginning to support that kind of investment.""

Antiguan cannabis grower Michaelus Tracey says that a lot of effort is put into developing new strains

Rub the leaf and inhale the fragrance, Michaelus Tracey is saying.

The musky scent of this cannabis plant is distinctly different from the citrusy aroma of another that he is also holding.

To the untrained eye, the neat rows of flowering cannabis crops in front of us are indistinguishable from each other.

Yet master cultivator Tracey can identify the separate varieties by their smell and the shape of their leaves.

Nine strains are being grown here at Pineapple Road, a farm deep in the countryside on the Caribbean island of Antigua. The warm temperatures, abundant sunshine, and high humidity make this prime territory for growing the plants.

Intense trials were conducted to produce the various strains, Tracey explains. ""We wanted different flavour profiles as well as different effects, but all with a medicinal value - something to help you relax, something to give you more energy, more pain relief, less anxiety.""

Gemma Handy

Cannibis plants thrive in Antigua's warm, sunny conditions

Last year marked a decade since Jamaica decriminalised the recreational use of cannabis and legalised its production and sale for medical reasons. Several other Caribbean nations, including the twin island country Antigua and Barbuda in 2018, have since followed suit.

Smoking cannabis is emblematic of Caribbean culture, to the extent it has become a cliché. But while the region's affection for the plant is well documented, its status as a leader in the field is less so.

Today the region is home to a plethora of legally registered cannabis farms and medicinal dispensaries, where both locals and tourists can purchase the drug if they have a valid medical authorisation card.

Yet Prof Rose-Marie Belle Antoine, an expert on the cannabis industry in the Caribbean, believes there needs to be further liberalisation.

""Decriminalisation isn't good enough,"" says Antoine, a former chair of the Caribbean Community's Regional Commission on Marijuana. ""We should just make it legal but regulated.""

Antoine is campus principal at the University of the West Indies in Trinidad, where researchers are due to start studying various potential benefits of cannabis.

Areas tipped for study range from alleviating the side effects of cancer treatment, to how the plant can boost agriculture by improving soil health. The research will take place in Antigua, where legislation is more progressive.

The work offers ""a lot of potential"", she says, but adds that legalisation would make life easier.

""The Caribbean is a leader in cannabis, in terms of strains and knowledge, and it has a long tradition of this. But legalities, the 'war on drugs' and all that nonsense, stifled not just the industry, but research and development,"" says Antoine.

Trump expands access to cannabis in a major shift in drug policy

Some in the region hope that US President Donald Trump's 

executive order

 in December to reclassify cannabis as a lower-level drug will benefit the Caribbean.

""It's a significant milestone,"" says Alexandra Chong, chief executive of Jamaica-based business Jacana, which sells a range of products derived from cannabis, from extract oil drops to skin cream.

""So much US public policy gets filtered down to the Caribbean,"" she says. ""Because cannabis was classified as a schedule one drug alongside heroin in the US, regulatory bodies across the Caribbean have not been as bullish with [reducing] regulation.""

Chong adds that the US reducing cannabis to the lower schedule three level, which also includes combined paracetamol-codeine tablets, was ""far more appropriate"".

The White House lowering the classification of cannabis may mean that in the future Caribbean nations can export the drug to the US for recreational use. 

However, the importation of such cannabis into the US is currently still illegal under federal law. This is despite 24 US states having now legalised the use of the drug recreationally.

Producers in both Jamaica and Antigua are keen to start legally exporting the drug. Jamaica's Cannabis Licensing Authority says it ""has put in place interim administrative procedures 

to facilitate the export of ganja

 by licensees that hold a valid import permit from the country that the product will be exported to"".

Meanwhile, Antigua and Barbuda's Medicinal Cannabis Authority is working hard to develop a cannabis export industry. ""We already have the legal framework in place, a prime geographical location and an international airport,"" the body's chief executive Regis Burton tells the BBC.

He says it's ""highly likely"" that Antigua will eventually be able to export its products, not least for the novelty value. ""Very few people can say they've tried Antiguan cannabis,"" he adds.

Jacana

Alexandra Chong hopes that Trump's move will lead to more liberalisation in the Caribbean

Domestically, high overheads in both Jamaica and Antigua and Barbuda – and rules that limit the sale of cannabis to people with medical approval - are said to be leaving most of the market to illegal producers.

Jacana estimates that more than 800,000 people a year in Jamaica use cannabis, of whom half are tourists. But that 90% of the 87 tonnes of the drug consumed per annum comes through illicit channels.

Chong adds that ""over-regulation has strangled the industry. Over time it's got easier, but it's by no means perfect"".

She says that due to these problems, she estimates that of the 160-plus licences of various categories granted by Jamaica's Cannabis Licensing Authority between 2017 and 2024, ""very few"" are still in operation.

In Antigua, Robert Hill, a consultant to the industry, says: ""It's still more profitable to import cannabis illegally. Unlike dealers, private companies have staff and bills to pay.""

Currently the island has just six cannabis farms, four dispensaries and a cannabis lounge, where people can smoke on the premises. At the same time, Antiguan authorities intercepted 45kg of illegally imported cannabis in just 24 hours back in September.

Meanwhile, Antigua has been innovative in its approach to domestic illegal growers. Instead of prosecutions, violators were invited to take part in a free six-week course to teach them how to enter the market legally.

""Twenty-two have already graduated, with two soon to transition to a medicinal business,"" Burton tells the BBC. ""The industry won't be successful if the illicit market does as it pleases.""

The continuing liberalisation of cannabis across the Caribbean is also said to be having a positive impact on social justice for one community in particular.

In 2018, Antigua's Prime Minister Gaston Browne issued a formal apology to the country's Rastafarians, for decades of historic persecution, stigma and abuse over their cannabis use. Six years later, the government granted Rastafarians official sacramental authorisation to grow the plants.

And last summer, it announced plans to expunge the criminal records of people previously prosecuted for possession of small amounts of marijuana.

Gemma Handy

Rastafarian High Priest Selah, left, says that efforts to allow the legal use of cannabis were hard fought 

But for High Priest Selah, of Antigua's Nyabinghi denomination of Rastafarians, memories of the harassment he and others once suffered still linger.

""The police were always coming and locking us up, destroying our plants, tarnishing our name and embarrassing us in public,"" he recalls. Campaigners from his community played a major role in getting the plant decriminalised.

Back at Pineapple Road, two employees are carefully hand-rolling joints, each one containing a gram of pure marijuana, for sale in the company's dispensary.

Burton hopes more local growers will get on board and keep the industry's proceeds in Caribbean hands.

Hill agrees. ""We have the ability to compete with much bigger countries thanks to our climate which reduces costs,"" he says, adding: ""We're not trying to create an Amsterdam, this is about wellness.""

Donald Trump has made clear he covets Greenland.

Now he claims to have secured the 

""framework"" of a future deal

, to address defence on the island - a deal that he says includes rights to rare earth minerals.

So what natural resources does Greenland have?

Greenland is believed to sit on top of large reserves of oil and natural gas.

It is also said to be home to the vast majority of raw materials considered crucial for electronics, green energy and other strategic and military technologies – to which Trump has been pushing to secure America's access.

Overall, 25 of 34 minerals deemed ""critical raw materials"" by the European Commission are found in Greenland, including graphite, niobium and titanium, according to the 2023 Geological Survey of Denmark and Greenland.

Greenland's strategic importance is ""not just about defence"", Senator Ted Cruz, a Republican from Texas, said at a Senate hearing last year about the potential acquisition of Greenland, pointing to the island's ""vast reserves of rare earth elements"".

Trump has sometimes downplayed the importance of those resources, pointing to what he claims is rising Russian and Chinese influence in the region to justify his claims that the US has to ""have"" the island.

""I want Greenland for security - I don't want it for anything else,"" he told reporters at the World Economic Forum in Davos on Wednesday, pointing in part to the difficulty of exploring in the Arctic region. ""You have to go 25ft down through ice to get it. It's not, it's not something that a lot of people are going to do or want to do.""

But access to the island's natural resources have loomed large in the background for the administration, which has put the US economy at the centre of its geopolitical vision and has made combatting China's dominance of the rare earths industry a priority.   

Trump's interest in controlling Greenland is ""primarily about access to those resources, and blocking China's access"", according to Steven Lamy, professor of international relations at the University of Southern California.

Even before Trump's second term, the US had been tightening its ties with Greenland, including by reopening its consulate in the island's capital, Nuuk, in 2020, responding to Russia and China's expanding military presence in the Arctic.

Since Trump returned to office, his allies have talked up the island's commercial potential, as rising temperatures expand sea routes and opportunities to explore the region's fisheries and other natural resources, especially those related to defence, such as energy and critical minerals, that the administration sees as a priority.

""This is about shipping lanes. This is about energy. This is about fisheries. And, of course, it's about your mission, which is keeping us safe and monitoring space, monitoring our adversaries, and making sure the American people can sleep safely in their homes, day in and day out,"" Mike Waltz, the current US ambassador to the United Nations and then Trump's national security adviser, told US troops stationed in Greenland last year.

And Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry told CNBC this month that Trump was a ""business president"" who believed the island represented ""a more robust trading opportunity"".

What we know about Trump's  'framework of future deal' over Greenland

Why does Trump want Greenland and what could it mean for Nato?

Over the summer, the Trump administration signed off on the possibility of backing an American company's mining project in Greenland, via $120m (£90m) in financing from the Export-Import Bank of the United States.

The plan built on other deals the Trump administration has agreed with Australia and Japan, as well as private firms, to secure US access to supply and production of rare earths, an industry now dominated by China.

Dr Patrick Schröder, a senior research fellow at Chatham House, said the scale of Greenland's critical minerals holdings had the potential to ""shift the dial"" for the US, allowing it to reduce its reliance on China - a key priority for the administration.

But critics of Trump's designs on the island, say it is not clear why US control would be necessary to access the island's resources. 

Analysts also warn that tapping them is easier said than done.

Among other challenges, mining in Greenland currently is expensive and hampered by severe weather conditions, a lack of infrastructure and a small labour force, Lamy said.

While exploration permits have been given for 100 blocs of the island, there are just two productive mines in Greenland.

""Greenland has been trying to attract outside investments into its extractive industries for a long time, and has not had a lot of luck because the business case just hasn't really been there,"" said Mikkel Runge Olesen, a senior researcher at the Danish Institute for International Studies.

""It's true that there are huge quantities of minerals of various kinds in Greenland. However, it also costs a lot of money to extract those minerals.""

But Prof Andrew Shepherd, director of the Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling, said rapidly melting layers of ice are increasingly easing the process, exposing rock for potential mining and creating river runoff.

""Getting all the fieldwork done traditionally has been very hard to do because you have to get energy to remote regions,"" he told the BBC.

""With the melting ice, you get the potential for hydro power in the area where the land is being exposed… so this presents itself as an interesting prospect.""

Jennifer Spence, director of the Arctic Initiative at the Harvard Kennedy School, said when it came to mining in Greenland, ""it's all still about potential"". 

Still, she thinks the island's strategic shipping location and rare earths deposits were key factors drawing Trump's attention. 

""His logic is that there's a national security imperative,"" Spence said. ""My belief is that this is much more economically driven.""

Throxy founders from left to right:  Pablo Jiménez de Parga Ramos, Arnau Ayerbe and Bergen Merey

Even before he'd graduated from the University of Bath in 2024, Arnau Ayerbe landed a highly coveted role as an AI engineer with JP Morgan - yet he felt limited and uninspired.

""I realised very quickly that the person to my right and to my left were going to be me in 20 years, and I didn't want to become that,"" recalls London-based Ayerbe.

His best friend from high school in their native Madrid, Pablo Jiménez de Parga Ramos, who had also secured a corporate job after graduating from University College London, felt the same.

They joined forces in London in 2023 with Ayerbe's university friend, Bergen Merey, to launch Throxy, which creates AI agents for sales teams.

Now all aged 24, the trio have raised nearly £5m in two rounds of investor funding, and annual sales of almost £1.2m.

They're part of a growing number of 20-somethings who've taken the leap to start their own businesses. 

Data from Enterprise Nation

 shows that, in the UK, 62% of Gen Z - those born between 1997 and 2012 - want to start a business.

That's reflected in trends seen in data from the British Business Bank's Start Up Loans programme. It shows that the number of loans awarded to Gen Z founders has doubled in the past five years.

For the young entrepreneurs at Throxy, it's been a rewarding but gruelling experience.

Ramos declares that there's no nine to five culture at Throxy, rather a ""9-9-6"" ethos of working 9am to 9pm, six days a week.

And Ayerbe adds: ""If I had known the amount of effort and work I needed to do to take the company to this point, I would probably have never started it.""

Throxy's founders say one big advantage they have on their side compared with other generations is their familiarity of AI.

For Garcia, it felt natural to build an AI-led business.

""I was working with early models of Chat GPT on research projects before they were released to the public on research, and it honestly felt like magic.

""It felt like there was going to be something transformational here that is going to fundamentally change the way we as humans do work, for the better,"" he says.

Perhaps one day Ayerbe and his co-founders will be in charge of a company worth more than $1bn (£740m) - known as a unicorn. 

Research by investment network

 Antler suggests that the most successful AI start-ups are being founded by increasingly younger entrepreneurs. 

It analysed 3,512 founders of companies that went on to be worth more than $1bn. 

It found that the average age of an entrepreneur who founded an AI unicorn fell from 40 in 2020, to 29 in 2024.

But when you're running a business in your 20s, it seems hard to avoid your clients and partners, who are usually older, from underestimating you.

That's been the experience of Rosie Skuse, who, as a new business owner in her early 20s, was often mistaken for her boss's assistant - and she would have to break the surprising news that she was, in fact, the boss.

""Some people wouldn't even shake my hand. It was really tough, and I used to struggle loads with it. It's frustrating when people don't assume it's your company. Then I'd start to speak and people could see I know what I'm talking about,"" recalls London-based Skuse.

""Then they'd say, 'wow, you must be so proud - but you're so young'. That shock factor was almost like a secret weapon, because I would catch people off guard, and they would end up actually listening.""

Everywoman

Rose Skuse won an award last year for her entrepreneurship

Now 29, Skuse is the founder and CEO of Molto Music Group, a music and entertainment agency that counts high end names like The Dorchester, The Savoy, Soho House and Raffles as clients.

From its roster of over 300 musicians, Molto Music Group puts together bespoke house bands for those venues, often designing the stage and set too. It also works with luxury brands like Hermes and Patek Philippe on private events.

Despite launching in 2019, and the ensuing Covid pandemic causing her early clients to cancel their contracts, business is now strong. Molto Music Group made its first million in 2023, and turned over £1.6m in 2025. It employs seven full-time staff.

""I have no business education. It's all been trial by fire and learning as we go,"" says Skuse.

""I've had to work a lot on my tone and delivery - and my handshake - but being young and fostering a young company can be a breath of fresh air compared with our competitors. It's more memorable.""

But business founders who've gone before have some words of advice for their younger counterparts.

Lee Broders, 53, started his first business at 26, in IT, after serving 10 years in the military. He's been a serial entrepreneur since and now runs seven ventures, ranging from business mentoring to photography.

According to Broders, making your first million isn't the be all and end all - it's scaling a business to last into the future.

""Speed can often hide fragile foundations. Growing something quickly doesn't always equal sustainability or robustness,"" notes Mr Broders, who is based in Shropshire.

""It's great if you're turning over a million pounds, but if it's costing £990,000, and you're actually making £10,000 a year, that's very different.""

Flourish

Sarah Skelton says having a network is important for entrepreneurs

Sarah Skelton is the co-founder and managing director of Flourish, a recruitment firm for the sales industry.

She started her first business in 2024 aged 46, and is concerned that founders in their 20s may miss out on valuable leadership and management skills that may be best learned in a traditional work environment.

""It's great that in this day and age you can set up a business quite quickly. But I think you have to have lived experiences to be really strong at that leadership piece, which is the quite critical bit here,"" says London-based Ms Skelton.

She's the co-founder and managing director of Flourish, a recruitment firm for the sales industry.

""Also when you're growing a business, leaning on people in a network is really important. But of course, if you're super young and you're going straight into this, where's your network?

She adds: ""My network is 25 years of placing candidates, selling to different businesses, working across different countries. It's really tough when you're that young. How do you know who to lean on and where to find those people?""

Kia Slovakia

Kia's giant plant in Zilina, Slovakia, can produce 350,000 cars per year

In a giant factory surrounded by mountains covered in snow, a lift lowers the steel bodies of cars onto the start of an assembly line.

They've just been welded together by robots - there are 690 working in this factory.

Next an army of human workers in red trousers and white t-shirts will transform these steel shells into finished cars.

One of these vehicles drives off the end of the assembly line every minute, flashing its headlights.

This is the European factory of Korean car company Kia, just outside the city of Zilina in the north of Slovakia.

It represents, Kia says, an investment of €2.5bn ($2.9bn; £2.2bn).

Volkswagen also produces cars in Slovakia. So does Stellantis (formerly Peugeot-Citroen, Fiat and Chrysler), and Jaguar Land Rover. Volvo is opening an electric car factory here in 2027.

Slovakia, which is home to 5.4 million people, makes almost a million cars a year. This is a small number compared to the world's largest producers, such as the biggest, China, which manufacturers a whopping 31 million cars per annum.

Yet Slovakia is the number one producer on a per capita basis - relative to the size of its population.

Kia

""From a child, cars are my passion,"" says assembly line worker Marcel Pukhon, 48, one of the 3,700 people employed at the Kia plant.

""Now I am part of the team, and I can make the cars, so that's something that's a dream job.""

Marcel lived in Northern Ireland and England before moving back to his native Slovakia to work here.

At the door insulation part of the assembly line I also talk to Simona Krnova, 23. She studied business before coming here. This is not her dream job, she tells me, but it does have its good points.

""Half of my family works here, so I wanted to try. I like the people,"" she says.

As for her salary, she earns €1,300 per month. ""Good compared to other companies,"" she adds. And later on that will rise. Kia says the average at the facility is €2,400 per month.

That is substantially higher than the country's average monthly salary across the entire economy, which 

official figures show 

was €1,403 in 2023.

But at the same time it is considerably lower than the EU-wide average of €3,417.

Simona says she's proud of the fact that Slovakia makes so many cars. ""I like the fact that thanks to that, the production here supports our society,"" she says.

Kia assembly line worker Marcel Pukhon says he has his ""dream job""

Practically everyone who works at the Kia plant is Slovak. The Korean presence is a few dozen senior managers who live in a gated community they built specially on the outskirts of a village a couple of kilometres away.

When Slovakia was part of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, the cars it made were, by Western standards, shoddy, noisy, thirsty and slow.

But after the Velvet Revolution of 1989 sent the Communist rulers packing, Volkswagen started investing in Czechoslovak carmaker Skoda in 1991. By 2000 it owned the whole company.

Other foreign automobile manufacturers also started to invest in the new nations of the Czech Republic and Slovakia - the two parts of the former Czechoslovakia after its separation in 1993.

Car industry expert Petr Prokop says that back then the labour costs in Slovakia were 20% of those in Germany.

Prokop, the boss of Give Management Consulting, a Munich-based business that advises clients in the automotive sector, adds that Slovakia still has a considerable cost advantage.

""On one hand you still have lower wages,"" he says. ""I would say 60% of the Western wages. But you have also high productivity. So it's definitely competitive.""

Slovakia - small country, auto giant

Further down the Kia assembly line a machine that installs the cars' air conditioning systems plays a bit of Mozart as it moves forward to warn people to get out of the way. Many of the vehicles have their steering-wheels on the right, British-style.

The biggest market for the cars they produce at the factory is indeed the UK, where Kia is now the 

fourth best-selling brand

 after VW, BMW and Ford.

Spain, Italy and Germany are the next biggest markets in Europe for Kia cars.

Kia Europe's outgoing chief executive, Marc Hedrich, says that Slovakia's car manufacturing industry also benefits from the country's central location.  ""Slovakia is really in the heart of Europe, quite well-connected to the big markets,"" he says.

Slovakia's high rate of low-carbon energy generation, from hydro to nuclear, and growing use of renewables, also means that the country's electric cars are eligible for 

larger levels of government discounts 

when customers buy them, such as the UK's Electric Car Grant.

Another important Slovak advantage is its dense network of car industry suppliers. Some 360 companies work for the car industry. ""The supplier base is enormous,"" says Mr Hendrich, ""this is critical"".

Kia didn't want to go into details about the incentives it received from the Slovak government to start production in the country back in 2006.

Yet Hedrich did say it received a tax credit of €29m for transforming its Slovak production lines for its new electric vehicles, the total cost of which was €108m.

The Slovak government offers these incentives to carmakers because the benefits for the country are enormous.

""There has been a huge decline in unemployment, and a significant increase in the economic strength of the Zilina region thanks to Kia,"" says the city's mayor, Peter Fiabane.

""Today, more than 20,000 people are directly employed by Kia and other companies that are linked to Kia by production.""

Hedrich also points to the quality of available workers in Slovakia. At the Zilina's Technical School 100 students are on a Kia-sponsored ""dual programme"", whereby they alternate between studying and working at the factory.

At the separate University of Zilina, around 400 of its graduates get jobs connected to the automotive industry every year.

While Slovakia leads the way, other former Eastern-bloc nations have also seen Western and Asian carmakers set up factories. In the Czech Republic there's Hyundai, Toyota and VW, while in Poland it is Toyota, Stellantis and VW again.

Meanwhile, Audi, Mercedes-Benz and Suzuki have facilities in Hungary, Ford and Renault are in Romania, and Ford is in Serbia.  All are attracted by low wages, and a tradition of industry and educated workers.

America is known as the land of big cars and even bigger SUVs but Donald Trump has an idea that could change that.

The president wants to bring to the US tiny vehicles, like those commonly seen on the streets of Japan, in the form of mini hatchbacks and vans half the size of a Ford F-150 pickup truck.

So-called Kei cars - short for kei-jidōsha, literally ""light vehicle"" - became popular in Japan after World War Two as an economical means of transport in its crowded cities. They have also become popular across Asia. 

Despite Trump's enthusiasm for micro-cars, importers and drivers in the US aren't so sure they are a viable option in the vast country.

Among the obstacles are whether manufacturers can keep prices low, make the vehicles safe enough and if big-car-loving Americans can be convinced to downsize.

After a visit to Japan, Trump said in an online post in December: ""I have just approved TINY CARS to be built in America.""

""These cars of the very near future are inexpensive, safe, fuel efficient and, quite simply, AMAZING!!! START BUILDING THEM NOW!""

His suggestion marks a shift that would undo a long-running rule barring small American-made vehicles.

While there are already some Kei cars in the US, they are a rare sight and have to be at least 25 years old to run legally on American roads.

Business accounts manager Nevi Bergeron bought her turbo-charged yellow 1997 Suzuki Cappuccino three years ago after being inspired by the Japanese street racing manga series Initial D.

Like most Kei cars, it is so small that two can fit into a standard parking space.

""I fell in love with that car and instantly knew I had to get one,"" said Bergeron, a member of a local enthusiasts group from Maryland and Washington DC called the Capital Kei Car Club.

""It's tiny and a bit silly... definitely a conversation-starter. You get a lot of glances when you drive around the city,"" she said. ""I just feel so happy in it.""

But despite loving the petite coupe, she wouldn't recommend it as a daily runaround.

""It is fun to drive but it is not exactly what I'd call safe,"" Bergeron said. ""On a highway next to big trucks, you definitely feel vulnerable.""

For the same reason, Capital Kei Car Club founder Andrew Maxon drives his Autozam az-1 mini-coupe ""like a motorbike"" - always assuming that other vehicles, especially trucks, have not seen him.

US transport secretary Sean Duffy said as much, acknowledging that small cars would ""probably not"" be well-suited to American freeways.

But these cars could be a ""great solution"" for people who drive in cities, Duffy said on business news channel CNBC.

Smaller cars, smaller prices?

Key to Trump's enthusiasm for small cars is the promise of lower prices.

A spokesperson for the US transport department told the BBC that the move will help Americans afford vehicles that meet their needs, whether electric, petrol-powered or in the form of a ""mini-van or micro"".

But it is yet to be seen if American manufacturers can build small cars at prices lower than existing sedans.

Car prices in the US have yet to return to pre-pandemic levels after a global shortage of computer chips was one of the factors that drove up prices.

At the same time, American households have faced a rising cost of living.

Carmakers have also warned that Trump's tariff policies could further push up prices, while the ending of a subsidies on electric vehicles (EVs) also means drivers have to pay more for some cars.

Small vehicle manufacturers, like Smart, have also tried to break into the US market

Hyundai chair Chung Eui-sun warned in his New Year's message that geopolitical conflicts, trade tensions and growing competition this year could cause issues ""we have long worried about to become reality"" in the car industry.

This year, new car sales in the US may fall below 16 million, according to research group Cox Automotive, in part due to concerns over prices as well as lower demand for EVs. In particular, lower income drivers are expected to feel the strain of “prolonged inflation” and the higher price of new and old cars, it added.

It is unclear how many car companies will respond to Trump's call.

Fiat owner Stellantis said it will start selling the Topolino, a small car with a top speed of under 30mph (48.3km/h), to the US in the coming months.

A Stellantis spokesperson said the firm is ""always looking for opportunities to adapt our product portfolio to meet our customers' needs"" and give them the choice of cars ""they want at prices they can afford.""

Japan's Nissan told the BBC it will assess its line up based on demand. Mitsubishi said it did not have any current plans to bring its Kei cars to the US.

Major Kei carmakers like Toyota, Honda and Suzuki said they did not have information to share when contacted by the BBC.

Car industry investor Steve Greenfield doesn't believe Trump's announcement will amount to much.

Modern Kei cars won't meet US safety regulations and carmakers will need to make huge investments to redesign them to meet American standards, he said. Doing so would ""defeat their cost and efficiency advantages"", Greenfield added.

In the past, manufacturers of small cars have struggled to break into the American market.

Kei cars could make sense in crowded urban areas, ""but for most use cases in the US, these small cars just simply won't be a viable option,"" said Greenfield.

In 2019, Smart, which is owned by Germany's Mercedes-Benz and Geely of China, pulled out of the US due to slow sales as drivers favoured bigger vehicles.

If the fate of Smart cars has shown anything, ""there may not even be much of a demand for small vehicles"" other than enthusiasts, said Greenfield.

That seems to be the case among most US customers who buy Kei cars, said Mo Sulai, an importer at Tokyo Motors DC in Maryland.

Imported Kei vehicles cost anywhere from $6,500 for an old mini van or above $10,000 for a Kei fire engine or lorry.

Nearly three quarters of the cars imported by his family-run business are ""novelty"" vehicles like tiny coupes - statement pieces that are popular at

 

events such as enthusiast meet-ups.

Mini vans and trucks have also been popular among some drivers who want to use them at golf courses or on farms, Sulai added.

""[Trump's] announcement was like a free advert for us because more people start to learn about Kei cars,"" Sulai said. 

""But even so, I think people in the US are so used to big cars. This will still be a niche market.""

China's electric cars are becoming slicker and cheaper - but is there a deeper cost?

The US has fewer but more ""tech dense"" farms according to a government report

Jake Leguee is a third-generation farmer in Saskatchewan, Canada.

Since his grandfather bought 640 acres in 1956, the farm has grown to its current size of 17,000 acres, growing canola, wheat, flax and green lentils.

As a child, he watched his father and grandfather spending hours riding their tractor to sow seeds and spray crops. Sweat would coat their shirts after those long, hot days.

""It was a lot less efficient back then,"" says Leguee. ""Today, technology has vastly improved the job that we do.""

To keep his farm competitive, Leguee has made several innovations, particularly when it comes to crop spraying. 

With software and remote cameras attached to his John Deere tractor, he can kill the weeds much more efficiently, a practice every farmer has to do before planting seeds.

""It can look down and spray a nozzle when the sensors pick a weed, while we're going around 15 miles an hour,"" Leguee says.

He adds that he saves on pesticide spray since the nozzles only turn on when weeds are detected, as opposed to the kind of blanket spraying he used to do.

The return-on-investment for adding these new layers to his farm operations are often high, Leguee adds.

""There are low-cost solutions that won't be as expensive as new spraying tech, and they could be an app to help you better keep your records, for example,"" he says.

It's a lesson that farmers across North America are taking on board.

A 2024 McKinsey survey

 found that 57% of North American farmers are likely to try new yield-increasing technologies in the next two years.

Another report, from 2022, 

by the US Department of Agriculture

 said that while the number of farms in the country is shrinking, the farms that remain are becoming ""tech dense"".

Norah Lake, the owner and farmer at Vermont's Sweetland Farms, says to get a successful harvest, ""there's a lot of looking forward and then backwards and then forwards and then backwards in crop farming"".

She once used Microsoft Excel to plug in the figures for, say, their yields from a recent harvest, or a given year, and see how they compare to years prior.

""I'd want to know that if we planted 100 bed feet of broccoli, what did we actually produce?"" she says.

More recently, Lake, who grows vegetables such as asparagus, tomatoes and zucchini, as well as pastured meat, has been using software and an app from a company called Tend.

She wanted to digitise and streamline those laborious tasks into a piece of tech that she can view on her cellphone or computer.

Now she can input those harvest numbers into Tend, and the software can give her details, and advice, on how to manage her crop best for the coming harvest.

""We can use Tend to calculate the quantity of seed that we need to order based on the row feet of a particular crop that we want to harvest,"" she says.

Cropwise uses 20 years of weather data to help help advise farmers

There's no shortage of tech for farmers to choose from.

Sygenta, the argri-tech giant based in Switzerland, offers farmers the software Cropwise, which uses AI and satellite imagery to guide farmers on what to do next with their crops, or alerts them to emergencies.

""It can tell the farmer that you need to visit the southeast corner of your field because something is not right about that section, such as a pest outbreak,"" says Feroz Sheikh, chief information office of Syngenta Group. ""And the system also has 20 years of our weather pattern data fed into a machine learning model, so we know exactly what kind of conditions lead to what outcome.""

With that data, farmers can cover their crops before, say, an incoming snap frost that could kill a large portion of their acreage.

In Germany, Jean-Pascal Lutze founded NoMaze to give farmers a deeper understanding of how different crops will perform under climate conditions.

Its software is rolling out this year. ""We did field tests in a variety of environments and then created simulations through our computer model to give clients better insight into, say, how much water to use, how to get the maximum yield,"" he explains.

If the tech works then it could lead to lower food prices

The impact of these technologies might be felt by the consumer, says Heather Darby, an agronomist and soil specialist at the University of Vermont.

Bringing more food to market could translate to lower prices at the register, she says.

""When farmers get help to avoid crop failures, that could lead to a more controlled farm environment and a reliable and secure food system,"" says Darby.

Back in Saskatchewan, Leguee notes younger farmers are turning to technology while older tillers might resist major change.

He says that farmers need to be open to change.

""After all, when you think about it, some of these farms are multi-million-dollar businesses that are supporting multiple families. We need to embrace technology that works for us.""

""I heard someone say once: 'If you treat farming as a business, it's a great way of life, but if you treat your farming as a way of life, it's a horrible business.'""

Prices in the UK rose by 3.4% in the year to December, up from 3.2% recorded in November.

It means that inflation remains above the Bank of England's 2% target.

The Bank moves interest rates up and down to try to keep inflation on track. Six cuts since August 2024 have brought rates down to 3.75%.

What is inflation? 

Inflation is the increase in the price of something over time. 

For example, if a bottle of milk costs £1 but is £1.05 a year later, then annual milk inflation is 5%.

How is the UK's inflation rate measured?

The prices of hundreds of everyday items, including food and fuel, are tracked by the Office for National Statistics (ONS).

This virtual ""basket of goods"" is regularly updated to reflect shopping trends, with 

virtual reality headsets and yoga mats added in 2025

, and local newspaper adverts removed.

The ONS monitors price changes over the previous 12 months to calculate inflation.

The main inflation measure is called 

the Consumer Prices Index (CPI)

, and the latest figure is published every month.

What is happening to UK inflation?

Although the December CPI figure of 3.4% is above the Bank of England's target, it remains well below the 11.1% figure reached in October 2022, which was the highest rate for 40 years.

The increase in average prices recorded in December - the first for five months - 

was slightly more than expected

. 

However, analysts do not think it marks the start of a longer, upward trend because December's data included one-off factors such as flight costs over Christmas and an increase in tobacco tax announced in the November Budget.

The Bank of England also considers other measures such as ""core inflation"" when deciding whether and how to change rates.

This doesn't include food or energy prices because they tend to be very volatile, so it can be a better indication of longer-term trends.

Core CPI was also 3.4% in the 12 months to December, up slightly from 3.2% in the 12 months to November.

Why are prices still rising?

Although inflation has fallen significantly since the October 2022 high, that doesn't mean prices are falling — just that they are rising less quickly.

Inflation soared in 2022 because oil and gas were in greater demand after the Covid pandemic, and energy prices surged again when Russia invaded Ukraine.

It then remained well above the 2% target, partly because of higher food prices.

Food price inflation 

has continued to be an issue

. 

It rose to 4.5% in the year to December 2025, with the price of bread and cereals partly behind the rise.

Why does putting up interest rates help to lower inflation?

When inflation was well above its 2% target, the Bank of England increased interest rates to 5.25%, a 16-year high.

The idea is that if you make borrowing more expensive, people and businesses have less money to spend. People may also be encouraged to save more.

In turn, this reduces demand for goods and slows price rises.

But it is a balancing act - increasing borrowing costs risks harming the economy.

For example, homeowners face higher mortgage repayments, which can outweigh better savings deals.

Businesses also borrow less, making them less likely to create jobs. Some may cut staff and reduce investment.

In recent months, inflation has remained above the Bank's target at the same time as the economy has remained relatively flat and the jobs market has softened.

Therefore, the Bank has chosen to cut rates, despite high inflation, in an attempt to encourage people to spend more and get businesses to invest and create jobs to boost the economy.

What is happening to UK interest rates and when will they go down again?

The Bank of England began cutting rates in August 2024. 

Six cuts since then have brought rates down to 3.75%, the lowest level since early 2023. 

The 

most recent cut in December 2025

 reflected concerns over rising unemployment and weak economic growth.

However, it was tight vote, with policymakers voting 5-4 in favour of a cut.

The Bank said rates were ""likely to continue on a gradual downward path"" in 2026, but warned decisions on future cuts were likely to be even closer. 

The next interest rate decision is on Thursday 5 February.

How will the interest rate cut affect my mortgage and savings?

Are wages keeping up with inflation?

The 

latest official figures

 show that regular pay in the UK 

grew by more than inflation between September and November

.

Average annual growth in pay (excluding bonuses) during the three-month period fell slightly to 4.5%, down from 4.6% recorded in August to October.

After taking inflation into account, it means wages grew by 0.9% between September and November.

Annual average regular earnings growth for the period was 7.9% for the public sector and 3.6% for the private sector.

Meanwhile, 

separate ONS figures showed

 the estimated number of job vacancies in the UK fell by 2,000 (0.2%) to 729,000 between September and November 2025.

The unemployment rate was 5.1% between September and November, the same as between August and October.

This the highest figure since since January 2021, just below the peak rate seen during the Covid pandemic, which will also factor into the Bank of England's interest rate decisions.

What is happening to inflation and interest rates in Europe and the US?

The US and eurozone countries have also been trying to limit price increases,

 

but both have lower central bank interest rates than the UK.

The inflation rate for countries using the euro was 1.9% in December, 

according to EU data

 — down from 2.1% in the previous month.

 

Preliminary data for January suggest that 

the rate fell further to 1.7% last month

.

Between June 2024 and June 2025, the European Central Bank (ECB) cut its main interest rate from an all-time high of 4% to 2%, where it has remained.

In the US, price increases have eased in recent months. The latest figures show 

prices rose 2.7% over the 12 months to December

, down from 3% in September.

In December, the US Federal Reserve 

cut its target interest rate for the third time in 2025

, putting it in a range of 3.50% to 3.75% — its lowest level in three years.

Earlier in the year, the Fed had 

come under attack from US President Donald Trump

 for not cutting rates. 

Trump has picked Kevin Warsh to lead the Fed

 when current chairman Jerome Powell's four-year term ends in May.

Plate of Plenty opened at the Guardians Grow charity base at the Abbeygate Shopping Centre

A social supermarket aiming to provide affordable food to people who are struggling with the cost of living has opened in Nuneaton.

Plate of Plenty is run by the charity Guardians Grow and based at the Iris Project in the town's Abbeygate Shopping Centre.

The charity spent about a year on the project after helping more than 300 local families referred to them for assistance.

Guardians Grow founder Sioux Watkins said the supermarket also aimed to help users ""make sure you are getting the support you need from other services"".

The supermarket is different to a food bank, because users register and then pay £5 per person to select up to 15 items from the range of goods on offer.

People registered with Plate of Plenty pay £5 per person and can choose up to 15 items

Watkins said the service started eight months ago, in a cupboard under the stairs of their main base, The Makery, also at the Abbeygate Shopping Centre.

""We had around 300 individuals and families using the service and the cupboard under the stairs got a bit busy. So we decided to launch the supermarket in the store next to our hub.""

Watkins said the social supermarket built on the other work the charity does, tackling loneliness and isolation.

Paul Graham said he was impressed with the range of items on offer

Paul Graham from Nuneaton used the service when it was based under the stairs of the Makery, and said the social supermarket was important to help those who might be struggling to make ends meet.

""There are people like myself who do struggle. I don't work through ill-health and therefore once the utility bills and rent are paid, there is very little left over for food.""

The aim of the social supermarket is twofold, according to Watkins.

""We're not just here to offer you the social supermarket, we're here to make sure you're accessing every service that's available to you. We'll make sure you are getting the support you need from other services.""

Watkins said the charity also hoped to open a community kitchen in the town centre, offering people the chance to learn about food and how to cook it.

Plate of Plenty currently opens between 10:00 and 14:00 on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, although opening on a Monday is being considered, depending on more people volunteering.

Chrissy Salmon said food banks were in need of lunchbox items for families

Food banks in Guernsey say they are seeing more dual income households using their services. 

Chrissy Salmon, team leader at Shiloh Church, said over the past six months they had seen ""a lot more people coming through"" as well as a lot ""coming for the first time"".

According to a 2024 survey by the Guernsey Community Foundation, 36% of the island's lowest income households had reported using a food bank but Salmon said the demographic was now shifting.

""What's really changed is that you've got two people working in a home"" who ""still aren't being able to meet the needs of what the family life entails,"" she explained, adding: ""I think it's a sort of a sad picture of our community at the moment.""

Salmon put the change down to islanders finding the cost of living, particularly rents, high.

According to the 

latest property price bulletin,

 the average rental price is £2,112 a month.

The ""extra need"" means there is a stretch on the food bank, she said.

Simon Fairclough said the Guernsey Welfare Service saw about 550 households over Christmas 

Simon Fairclough, manager of the Guernsey Welfare Service, said while its food bank's stores looked full, if they stopped receiving donations their stocks would ""empty in about a week"".

He said in 2025 the service had seen about 720 different households.

But so far this year, it was seeing, on average, five new households a week, he said.

""I think probably a lot of people have got in their minds the sort of person who would come to a welfare office, well, forget that, we see a whole range of people here.""

Politicians are currently debating bringing in a Goods and Services Tax (GST)

, which could include food, if the States Assembly approves the preferred option of the government's most senior committee, Policy and Resources (P&R).

Fairclough said while support was likely to be made available to households that qualified, it could still affect donations to the food bank.

""You would think that the price of that going up, people will feel less able to help. We just hope that we can continue to rely on the generosity of the community.""

'Recognising' the problem

Jim Roberts, chief executive of the Guernsey Community Foundation, said there was a steady and ""alarming increase"" in food bank usage.

He agreed with Chrissy Salmon's assessment that the extra squeeze was often down to rent prices.

""Private rents have increased by around 60 to 65 percent since 2018, and by 50 percent since 2020, you don't need to think very long before you realise, well, wages have not increased by a comparable amount.""

In November, the President of the Housing Committee, Deputy Steve Williams 

mentioned that the possibility of introducing a rent cap

 in Guernsey would be looked at.

Roberts said ""a fundamental importance"" was ""recognising that we have a problem"".

He said it was a problem that needed to be tackled from the ground up: ""You're talking about economic growth in the hope that it trickles down to everybody.""

He added: ""Making certain services free to access, even if they're paid for elsewhere, adjusting benefit rates so that at least you ensure the lowest income households are adequately protected, or otherwise you're looking at, sort of, trying to control costs in other ways such as rent control.""

Jobe Ferguson says he is 'heartbroken' to be closing down the restaurant that he put his 'life and soul' into for 22 years

The owner of a popular bar and restaurant in Manchester said he was ""devastated"" to have had to close its doors after 22 years.

Jobe Ferguson said he had borrowed up to £100,000 and stopped paying himself a salary to try to keep the TNQ Restaurant & Bar in the city's Northern Quarter afloat.

He said he had met his wife and mother of his two children at the ""real neighbourhood restaurant"", adding: ""Founding TNQ changed my life and to close it is devastating.""

The 49-year-old said rising energy bills, soaring food costs and increased National Insurance Contributions had made it impossible to continue.

""It's been pretty horrendous,"" he said. ""Things have been difficult for a bit of time.

""Our energy bills have risen to £8,000 a month, the price of food is substantially higher, and changes to National Insurance Contributions - I can't make it work any more.""

TNQ

TNQ is on the corner of High Street and Copperas Street in Manchester's Northern Quarter

Ferguson added that his restaurant had survived ""banking crises, double-dip recessions and Covid"", and that he ""certainly didn't think it would go this way"".

""Small independent businesses should be looked after, not absolutely decimated by policy and big energy companies,"" he said. 

""TNQ has been my life. I put my heart and soul into it.

 ""There's so much heart in the place. To be honest, I can't get my head around it.""

Jobe Ferguson

Chef Anthony Fielden began working at TNQ 18 years ago and subsequently became a shareholder

Staff at the restaurant - some of whom had been there for up to 18 years - were told on Monday that the restaurant was closing.

""Everyone was in shock,"" said Ferguson.

""Some people were in tears and some were a bit annoyed to start with. 

""But I've been getting messages from all the staff, thanking me for the support since.""

Jobe Ferguson

The original team at TNQ's first Christmas party in 2004

Ferguson's decision to close came after the government announced plans to introduce a 

15% discount on business rates for pubs and music venues

 across England from April. 

The three-year package will be worth £1,650 for the average pub in 2026-27, according to the Treasury.

Ferguson, who owns several other premises in the Northern Quarter and beyond, said he still worried about the future.

""The monthly energy bills at TNQ and my other venues have quadrupled from pre-Covid to now - it's crazy expensive.""

He added that he had noticed other businesses having to make cutbacks by reducing their operating hours.

""The Northern Quarter is the creative hub of Manchester, which is an epic city,"" said Ferguson. 

""And the creative hub of that city is shut down on a Monday evening because you can't afford to staff it, and because you can't afford to turn your lights on.""

UK Hospitality has called for the government's upcoming support package to be widened - warning that hotels, restaurants and other businesses in the sector are also at risk.

A few weeks ago, I was driving along the M6 late at night, towards the West Midlands, when I came across the orange flashing lights and miles of cones that signify road works.

Two lanes were closed and the overhead gantry warned of a 50mph speed limit on the near-empty motorway.

My immediate reaction was an inward sigh. I clock up thousands of miles on Britain's roads as a result of my job presenting a Radio 4 programme from a different part of the country every week, so I understand road works often mean delays - and that can lead to frustration.

Brett Baines has been driving a HGV for close to 30 years and says that he has noticed more road works. 

""[They] seem to drag on for months, years,"" he says.

Now, we're likely to see even more works in England, according to National Highways, which manages the nation's motorways and major routes, as our ageing roads undergo much-needed upgrades and repairs.

For Brett Baines, a HGV driver, and his employer, there's a cost to delays. 'The knock-on effect can be late deliveries, [for] which sometimes the company or the customer gets charged'

Much of the network was built in the 1960s and 1970s, as car ownership expanded - but those roads and bridges are now reaching the end of their ""serviceable life"", explains Nicola Bell, the agency's executive director.

In Wales, too, a large amount of highways infrastructure was built in the 1960s and 1970s. Drivers can expect some ""essential maintenance work"", according to the Welsh government, though it's less clear there, as well as in Scotland and Northern Ireland, whether disruption from road works will increase in the same way as it's predicted to in England.

Problems on the roads have consequences. Most of us use roads to travel, but for many people they also mark a daily interaction with the machinery of the state, and they shape opinion of how well the country is - or isn't – working.

Plus, there is a cost to the economy. In all, 2.2 million street and road works were carried out between 2022 and 2023 in England, according to the Department for Transport (DfT), costing the economy around £4bn through travel disruption.

It's a fine balance between the benefits of improved infrastructure, versus the cost of disruption. But does the country have that balance right?

The scourge of street works

In the village of Clanfield in Hampshire, one resident, David, tells me he is frustrated. Utility companies have dug up the roads to replace old infrastructure, resulting in a patchwork of road closures and temporary traffic lights.

""We're just coming up to the famous four-way set,"" he says, approaching some temporary traffic lights. What frustrates him is how long they've been there.

""It's had a huge impact,"" he says. ""The issue I have around here is the co-ordination of it all.""

One resident from the village of Clanfield in Hampshire says he is frustrated by temporary traffic lights

SGN, which manages the gas network in the south of England, says it has been replacing 10 miles of ageing pipework. It is a ""particularly challenging"" project bringing ""vital improvements"", they say. It is due for completion in May.

A spokesperson said: ""[These] are for the long-term benefit of the local community and we are working hard to complete them as quickly and as safely as possible. We have maintained regular communication with the community throughout.""

Similar works are going on in other towns and villages.

Local roads have seen an increase in road works and street works - often to upgrade utilities like water, energy, and broadband. The Local Government Association of England and Wales (a body that represents councils, which are also highway authorities) cites a 30% increase in utility company works over the past decade.

For many residents, like David, that doesn't make it any less frustrating.

""It's necessary, I get that,"" he says. But in his view it comes down to two things: ""Communication and co-ordination.""

Money, fines - and the question of who decides

In England, councils are responsible for all highways other than major roads and motorways. When it comes to road works, some are carried out by councils (including patching-up roads in poor condition), while others are carried out by the utility companies.

Nick Adams-King, leader of the Conservative-run county council in Hampshire, admits the roads in his area are in poor condition; he says bringing them up to scratch would cost £600m. 

""[But] our annual budget is around £70m,"" he says.

Hampshire County Council leader Nick Adams-King estimates that repairing the roads from scratch in his area would cost around £600m

The government has increased funding for highways maintenance. It says the budget for local road repairs will be more than £2bn a year by 2030, up from £1.6bn in 2026-27.

But there is another issue, says Adams-King. ""The challenge for us is that the utility companies have a lot of leeway in their ability to influence when work is carried out.

""They also have the ability to declare some work an emergency piece of work, and as a consequence of that they can… put their diversion, their road closure, their temporary traffic lights in place, and only inform us six working hours later, by which point it's often too late for us to be able to properly manage what's happening.""

Local authorities employ various measures to reduce disruption, such as permit schemes, allowing them more control over how and when works take place.

However, councils have raised issues with one permit type - the ""immediate permit"", used for urgent or emergency works, and where there is no requirement to warn local authorities in advance.

These accounted for almost a third of all street works in England in 2023-4. Some councils have suggested they are being misused. 

One authority reported that a ""crackly phone line"" had been used as a reason for an immediate permit - even though it had been known about for weeks.

The budget for local road repairs will be more than £2bn a year by 2030, up from £1.6bn in 2026-27.

In July last year, a report by the House of Commons Transport Select Committee said these permits were essential but urged the government to consult on the definition of urgent works.

The government has also doubled the fines that local authorities can issue for street works offences (from £120 to £240).

Yet Streetworks UK, a body representing utility companies, insists most work – 69% – is carried out in a planned and co-ordinated way.

Clive Bairsto, its chief executive, says he doesn't think utility companies are over-using immediate permits, adding: ""The Department for Transport said there was absolutely no evidence to support that. I actually don't believe there is abuse of the system going on.""

Cost to businesses around the country

At a small shopping precinct in Rochdale, Greater Manchester is a pet shop called Amber Pets. Inside it's stocked with specialist pet food and animal toys and every kind of dog lead imaginable.

Its owner, Angela Collinge, has run it for 27 years - but now her business is being affected by road works. ""As soon as one lot's finished, another lot starts,"" she says. ""[There's] just hideous congestion every morning.

""People avoid coming this way and then they don't come into the shopping centre. We have seen a lot of regular customers disappearing.""

Utility companies in Rochdale say that essential works have taken place in the area to upgrade or maintain vital infrastructure, including gas pipes, water mains and broadband. 

They said they co-ordinated with the local council, that works were done as quickly and safely as possible, and steps were taken keep local residents informed.

Two firms are also trialling a new approach in which they carry out gas and water works simultaneously, to minimise disruption in the area. If successful, it could be extended.

But Paul Waugh, the local MP, believes they should be doing more. ""They need to realise the damaging economic impact,"" he argues.

He blames a long-term reliance upon ""make do and mend"". He says: ""We need a much better, more co-ordinated system.""

However, Clive Bairsto argues that the utilities companies do work hard to co-ordinate where they can.

The case of Wisley Gardens

This story of challenges facing businesses is told across the country.

Clare Matterson, director general of the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS), points to their gardens at Wisley, near junction 10 of the M25 in Surrey.

Over the past three-and-a-half years, National Highways has spent over £300m on a project to improve congestion and safety at this busy junction. 

But Matterson argues that her charity has lost nearly £14m as a result.

""We've dropped over 350,000 visitors in a year,"" she says. ""We had families sitting in their cars, we have a lot of older visitors getting very stressed about driving in those very difficult conditions.

""People got in touch with us and have said, 'We'll either cancel our membership until this is all over or we won't be coming visiting for a few years.'

""We've never disagreed that improvements should be made,"" she adds. ""But should it take so long? Should it have such a big disruption?""

And the project has been delayed, with an extra nine months of work that National Highways says is caused by extreme weather.

Now RHS Wisley is seeking compensation.

National Highways says it is attempting to minimise disruption by closing the M25 entirely over a series of weekends – an unprecedented step to speed up the works.

""Actually, you [are] going to get more done by closing it for five weekends throughout the duration of the works than prolonging that disruption by perhaps just closing one lane,"" says Nicola Bell of National Highways.

She adds: ""We do have every sympathy with a business like RHS Wisley, when you are building something as complex as that upgrade right next to their business.""

Motorway delays and 'short sharp shocks'

Overall, motorways and major trunk roads (known as the strategic road network) account for just 2% of England's roads by mileage, but it carries a third of all traffic and two-thirds of all freight.

Delays on England's major roads increased between 2019 and 2025, in part due to road works.

According to a report by the DfT on the performance of National Highways: ""The government is concerned with the rise in average delay and recognises how costly delays can be to businesses and how frustrating they are for road users.

""Addressing delays on the SRN (strategic road network) is a priority in driving economic growth.""

The government has announced plans to spend £25bn on the strategic road network between 2026 and 2031.

Another new approach has been tested out in Hampshire, where a new garden village of 6,000 homes has been built that requires an extra junction on the M27 between Portsmouth and Southampton.

A concrete tunnel designed to run beneath the motorway was constructed in a nearby field, then slid into place. It meant closing a stretching of the motorway in both directions over Christmas while the work was carried out.

John Beresford, managing director of Buckland Development, which is building the village, said the idea was to minimise the disruption on the motorway.

'Carspreading' is on the rise - and not everyone is happy about it

Why so many people break 20mph speed limits (it's more complicated than you think)

HS2 was doomed to be a mess, say insiders - because of a 'problem in this country'

""[We knew it was] going to be hell for all the local people for a bit of time,"" he says. ""[But it's] a short, sharp sort of shock, hopefully minimising the long-term disruption.""

James Barwise, policy lead at the Road Haulage Association, says short-term whole-road closures can have merits - though he acknowledges they can be ""scary [and] disruptive"" for locals.

""As it's telegraphed in advance, most hauliers would take fewer days of disruption where most of the work can be done completely rather than months of lane closures.""

Do lane rental schemes work?

Local authorities, meanwhile, are trying other solutions. Lane rental schemes mean utility companies are charged up to £2,500 per day for works on certain busy routes at peak times.

""A lane rental scheme that requires contractors and utility companies to pay for every day of lane closure, we believe would lead to more efficient and faster works being done,"" says councillor Tom Hunt, chair of the Local Government Association's inclusive growth committee.

At the moment only a handful of councils have these powers. MPs on the Transport Select Committee want it to be rolled out more widely across England. Ministers have said mayors will get the power to introduce these schemes in their areas.

Local authorities are trying different ways to limit disruption on busy routes

But Bairsto of Streetworks UK argues it could end up costing customers more. ""Lane rental is a cost of doing business and is passed directly on to the consumer.""

More broadly, he says, ""I think we have to bear a little bit of irritation and pain from time to time, just to ensure that we have the quality and standards of utilities we need to progress as a nation.""

Ultimately, three things keep cropping up in my conversations: co-ordination, communication and duration. And while there are some proposed solutions, no clear answers are immediate.

As Bell, from National Highways, puts it: ""Across all of our infrastructure, whether that's energy, water – you could argue they have all seen a lack of investment, which is why you're now seeing increased levels of road works as we now invest.""

And with a government that believes better infrastructure is a route to economic growth, it seems road works are here to stay.

The question is still whether they can be managed more effectively to limit the impact on daily journeys, businesses – and the collective blood pressure of the nation's motorists.

At a rail yard near Milton Keynes, a group of men in orange outfits are making final checks on huge slabs of railway track, preparing them so that they are ready to be installed over Christmas and New Year.

At a time when many commuters stop work to enjoy celebrations with friends and family, rail bosses get massive engineering projects and upgrades done.

So, those orange-clad workers are out in force.

Carl Foy has been on duty for roughly 20 of the 27 Christmases in his career. This year will add another to the tally - with his two grown-up sons, who are also rail workers, out there with him. Some friends think he's mad for doing it. But Carl says it's just accepted as part of the job.

""We bring in a few mince pies, the site offices might have a bit of tinsel around,"" he says. ""We make it as enjoyable as we can and just crack on with the work.""

PA

Major engineering works are taking place on Britain's rail network over the Christmas period

The £26m project they'll be working on this Christmas is one of the biggest scheduled across the country: Hanslope Junction, a crucial part of the West Coast Main Line, which is wearing out.

Each day almost 500 trains use it and an increasing number of faults are causing delays, the repercussions of which ripple throughout the network. Now, the whole thing, comprising four tracks, is to be re-laid.

It's a giant and complicated jigsaw puzzle of 130 separate track panels - not something that can be done when trains are roaring up and down. So, it will leave passengers with no trains between Milton Keynes and Rugby and Milton Keynes and Northampton not just late on Christmas Eve and on Christmas Day (as is usually the case) but up until the morning of 5 January. It means no direct trains linking London Euston with north-west England and Scotland for 11 full days.

It's a similar story up and down the country, with other projects, too, like updating signalling technology. In all, 5% of the rail network will be shut down over the festive period - part of a £160m engineering project organised by Network Rail.

PA

Network Rail, a publicly owned body, manages 20,000 miles of track across England, Scotland, and Wales

Many of these are huge jobs, not routine maintenance, that have been long planned, with funding allocated as part of Network Rail's five-yearly business plans.

The question is - with millions travelling across the country over the festive season, causing so much inconvenience to many, why schedule it now? And is it all a case of sensible planning - or an indicator of something amiss with Britain's rail network?

Frustration at Euston station

Chatting to passengers at London Euston station weeks before Christmas, it doesn't take long to find some who are affected.

""My sister-in-law is coming to visit and she's had real trouble trying to get a train,"" one woman tells me. ""Every train's got two or three changes."" Unable to find a direct service, and with a longer journey time, she changed the dates of her visit to avoid the disruption.

Another passenger, heading for the North of England, is wondering whether to get the train at all. ""It's easier for me to drive rather than run the risk of getting there and not being able to get back.

""Obviously there are a lot less commuters over the Christmas period, I can see why they do it at this time of year, but it's not great if you're trying to get home… to see your friends and family.""

Some passengers have complained about longer journeys caused by the disruption

The debate over why works should be scheduled over Christmas is a complex one: on the one hand, train bosses calculate that the effects on people travelling to work will be minimal, given how many businesses shut for Christmas.

""It's the quietest time of year for the railway and our customers, so we squeeze in as much work then to disrupt as few people as possible,"" explains Jake Kelly, a regional managing director at Network Rail.

But on the other hand it risks causing a ""bottleneck"", argues Gareth Dennis, a rail engineer, campaigner, and author of How the Railways Will Fix the Future.

He sees another problem too: ""It's extremely expensive. 

""All those workers, rightly, are getting paid way over the normal rate they would because they are sacrificing extremely important family and personal time working long hours over that period.""

Shutterstock

Rail bosses argue that doing works over Christmas causes less disruption because fewer people are commuting. But is that the right approach?

Mr Kelly acknowledges there is a price: ""It's always a difficult choice, and there is a cost of doing work over Christmas when families across the UK are celebrating.""

But, he says, it's a difficult trade-off between minimising disruption for customers versus cost.

Germany and France do it differently

When compared with other European countries, Britain is fairly unique (with the exception of Italy) in its ""particularly intensive approach"", as Mr Dennis puts it, to doing this sort of rail work at Easter and Christmas.

This is partly because rail networks in other countries, like Germany and France, are laid out differently.

""Where the country's more of a square shape, their rail network isn't kind of north-south, it's much more of a grid,"" he explains. ""So you can dodge around things more easily… and they can spread their engineering work out a bit more.""

Getty Images

In Germany, 'they can spread their engineering work out a bit more,' says Mr Dennis

The high level of passenger demand in Britain also poses a challenge. ""It has one of the most intensively used railways in Europe - [it] gets tired, gets worn out"".

The West Coast Main Line does not have the capacity to run any more trains, while the East Coast Mainline's new December timetable will make it much busier, he says.

But even this is only part of the story. Another factor that contributes to the network creaking in places is a legacy of underinvestment.

Years of 'mend and make do'

Stewart Palmer spent 38 years working on the railway, including spells at Network Rail's predecessor Railtrack, and as the managing director of what was then called South West Trains.

In the past – as far back as the post-war period - the money wasn't always there to do the work that was needed and for decades there was a tendency, he says, ""towards mend and make do"". 

The fact there is so much work to do now ""has emerged over a very long history"".

Engineering works have frequently been postponed, he adds. One way of keeping the railway running safely until work can be done has been by imposing speed restrictions on some parts of the track.

But the legacy of a Hertfordshire rail crash that happened 25 years ago is a reminder of the importance of ensuring that deteriorated rail is replaced in good time.

The Hatfield disaster of October 2000: a train carrying around 200 passengers derailed, killing four people

On a Tuesday in October 2000, a train carrying 12 staff and 170 passengers came to a catastrophic halt outside the town of Hatfield. Four of the nine carriages were derailed and three more were flung over on their side, killing four people.

An official investigation into the crash revealed a series of errors by rail bosses and engineers. One of those causes, 

highlighted by an inquiry,

 was a failure to identify and repair or replace the rapidly deteriorating rail.

""This caused us to do loads of engineering investigations, but it also resulted in renewing an enormous amount of rail all at once in a very fast period of time,"" Mr Dennis explains.

Extreme weather and the 'paperclip' effect

Then there is the impact of the weather. Network Rail has been clear that climate change poses a significant challenge. ""Extreme weather caused by climate change is on the rise. This will affect how safely and reliably we can run the railway,"" it says on its website.

These extreme weather events not only lead to equipment failures but affect how quickly things wear out too.

HS2 was doomed to be a mess, say insiders - because of a 'problem in this country'

'Carspreading' is on the rise - and not everyone is happy about it

Why so many people break 20mph speed limits (it's more complicated than you think)

William Powrie, a professor of Geotechnical Engineering at the University of Southampton, says climate change creates a long list of hazards for the railways. Take the hot summers - these heat railway tracks beyond temperatures they can handle, sometimes causing them to buckle, he says. High winds can also damage overhead lines.

He's particularly worried about what he calls the ""paperclip"" effect.

Many British railways are built on clay soil that shrinks in the summer as vegetation sucks out water, and expands in the winter. But this expand-and-shrink cycle is becoming more extreme, he warns.

""It's a bit like if you get a paperclip and bend it forwards, bend it backwards. It's OK for a bit - but eventually it will break.""

It's not only tracks that need looking after, but embankments and drainage along railway lines. In November, a train travelling from Glasgow to London on the West Coast Main Line 

derailed near Carlisle after hitting a landslip

, leaving four people injured.

Network Rail

In November, a train from Glasgow to London derailed near Carlisle after hitting a landslip

An independent investigation into the cause of a train derailment will look into a raft of potential issues. The Rail Accident Investigation Branch said its preliminary examination found a drainage channel was ""unable to accommodate the volume of water which was present"".

Network Rail say they are aware of climate change-related hazards - and they are moving money around to cope with it. Their latest five-year business plan earmarked £2.8bn to help deal with extreme weather and climate change.

Cost savings and 'tough choices'

Amid all of this, the organisation has committed to make cost savings of £3.9bn. Bosses have been clear about the financial pressures they face.

""Like many businesses, we continue to feel the impact of inflation and rising supply chain costs,"" Andrew Haines, Network Rail's then-chief executive said in an update this summer.

This means ""tough choices"", including ""prioritising assets that are located on busier parts of the network,"" he said.

But the regulator, the Office of Rail and Road, has warned that constrained funding forcing Network Rail to spend ""less on renewals and more on life-extending repairs and maintenance"" could mean ""more asset failures and therefore disruption to train services in the long-term"", plus potential higher costs in the future.

Of course, for millions of passengers this Christmas, their main priority will simply be getting home. People are being warned to check and plan ahead before they travel - a message as reliably present at this time of year as Christmas trees or mulled wine.

So, can railway passengers around the country expect a smoother Christmas next year?

Unlikely, argues Jake Kelly of Network Rail. A project like Hanslope Junction near Milton Keynes can be years in the planning.

With ""a pipeline that is three or four years long"", he says ""we're already starting to finalise [plans] for next year"".

Any big red box moment is risky.

And for a government disliked by millions there's peril at every turn.

Now the chancellor's big choices are out there, what's the best-case scenario for Reeves and Starmer, and what's the worst that could happen next?

On the positive side of the ledger, Labour MPs have gone off to their constituencies in a better mood this week. That is in large part down to the chancellor's decision to scrap the limit on bigger families getting some extra benefits.

The prime minister will revel in the argument for scrapping the cap in a big speech on Monday, suggesting it's not just the right thing to do for those in need, but the right move for the economy now and into the future. He'll also make the case the Budget will help families by easing energy bills and freezing rail fares.

And the long-awaited strategy on child poverty will likely see the light of day towards the end of the week.

It's about as clear an example of a Labour-friendly policy as there could be - redistributing taxpayers' cash to the least well-off.

One government source described it as a ""restatement of values, something that MPs wanted to see, government being more bold about what it believes in and what a Labour government is"".

In other words, giving Labour MPs something many of them - not just the left-wing fringe, but government ministers like Bridget Phillipson - had argued for, has cheered them right up after months of unhappiness and anxiety-fuelled conversations about what Keir Starmer stands for and whether he is up to the job.

House of Commons

While it's not a policy that is universally popular with the public, the decision makes it easier for the leadership to get their backbenchers on board and manage the party. But with a majority as big as they won in July 2024, it's solving a problem they ought never to have had.

A reliable party is a basic for any government that wants to be effective. And it shouldn't be an issue for an administration with a huge majority. But you don't need me to remind you Labour's time in office has been eventful at best, chaotic at worst, with the leadership unable to keep its MPs in line.

In the best-case scenario, the changes to benefits in the Budget gives Labour a clearer identity, an argument in the party's comfort zone that it's happy to make. From a political point of view, another government source says ""there'll be a body language change and we are going to enjoy the fight.""

If - and it is still an if - this calm can last, politics can settle down and businesses might feel more confident. The hope is that would unlock cash for the economy, despite big tax rises, big increases on welfare spending and the country's still whopping debts.

After all the preparation (more on the dark side of it later), there was no big meltdown in the markets on the day. Remember, market reaction matters because the government borrows lots and lots of money from investors who want it back one day.

Business leaders hope seeming stability hangs around and endless politicking ends. As one says: ""Best-case scenario is this gives stability - the government can crack on, and we see an uptick [in the economy]. It's not like other governments globally are smashing it.""

Another boss of a company worth billions told me: ""Twenty-six billion of extra tax is not normal, but I think the Budget will settle things down. We all love to criticise but maybe it is time to cut them some slack.""

The polls do not suggest for a second that the public at large is in the mood to do that. Early surveys of opinion after the Budget give Reeves's plans short shrift. More than a million people will be paying more income tax or paying it for the first time - not a traditional reason for cheer.

Inflation is expected to be higher for this year than expected. And the growth in people's spending power is predicted to be 

""dismal""

. But for one member of the government, the best-case scenario ""has to be an uptick in the polls and a stronger message for May"", referring to a mega set of elections in Scotland, Wales and across different parts of England where Labour is roundly expected to get hammered, and Keir Starmer's job is expected to hang in the balance.

The Budget has not brought that moment of jeopardy any closer, which given how rocky things have been, is a win of sorts. But one party insider grimly joked, after this week: ""The best-case scenario for the PM is that he gets to May, and then there is a failed challenge.""

What about the worst-case scenario?

The ink on the Budget headlines was barely dry when along came another political fuss about a 

partial u-turn on expanding workers' rights

. For some in the party, the timing was incomprehensible - one senior figure told me, exasperated: ""in terms of managing your party, why do it this week? You'd calmed everybody down, bond yields happy, Labour backbenchers happy, then you throw it all up in the air again!""

Separate to the Budget process, unions and business and ministers had been trying to find a compromise over how long workers would have to be in a job before getting the right to claim they'd been unfairly sacked.

For some in the unions and the party, dropping day-one protection from unfair dismissal was a necessary compromise to make sure the bigger changes to workers' rights could pass through Parliament. But it has angered some on the left.

A source close to the talks with the unions and business told me ""you can't grid the negotiations"" - in other words, the announcement couldn't be fitted into a neat government timetable.

The partial climbdown is not likely to result in an enormous bust-up – one of Angela Rayner's steadfast allies who pioneered the wider plans said they were a ""little concerned"" rather than frothing with rage. But the spat punctures any suggestion that the Budget will end grumps and strops inside the party.

And listen to this warning from another source in the Labour movement: ""It's a ludicrous thing to have done – it was a clear manifesto pledge. It's not complicated and it's made the Labour-trade union relationship more difficult and created unnecessary tension for Starmer and Reeves in the event of things tanking after local elections.""

In other words, leadership watch out.

For all the political focus, the Budget is of course also a huge economic moment and it simply isn't pretty. Debt is still sky-high. Growth is predicted to be still sludgy for years, slower than expected all the way up until 2030. State spending, particularly on welfare, is going up and up.

It's hard to reconcile that with Reeves and Starmer's language before and after the general election: that helping business make money and hire more people - growth - was at the top of their list.

One city figure told me: ""The left side of Labour might hate business but that's what pays for the things they want - it cannot fund the triple lock, welfare, and the NHS unless the economy grows.""

Another senior business figure told me: ""I think we are bit screwed aren't we - by end of the decade we are going to spend nearly 400 billion on pensions and welfare - growth is clearly not at the top of the list.""

The minimum wage is going up. Business rates are going up for many companies. Even one union figure told me ""growth's gone as a priority"".

For one city insider, there is a sense that Reeves's effort to play nice with the business community before the election had been for nothing. ""They've sacrificed any opportunity they had to really drive growth, support aspiration and build an economy around thriving businesses and entrepreneurship in favour of saving their jobs. Taxpayers and business have been betrayed and both have long memories.

""All of the pre-election talk about being the party of business and growth was bullshit. Everyone recognises that now and they won't forget.""

Government figures dispute this. Pointing to decisions on Heathrow and new nuclear, they hit back: ""If those businesses want to employ decent people in the years to come, it's quite a good idea those children don't go hungry when they are growing up.""

PA Wire

Starmer himself will insist the government is just as committed to growth as it's always been in his speech next week, and is likely to emphasise his desire to get rid of red tape and speed up the planning system. Downing Street insiders suggest it's bogus to suggest the new focus on child poverty means they're not interested in helping business grow any more.

Multiple sources suggest Labour switching to a more traditional focus to please its party removes what sometimes felt like a contradiction - a focus on helping business make money at the same time as pursuing its own values.

One former minister suggested that since the high-tax, high-spend Budget, the difference between the two parties was now as clear as it was in 1992.

But in the worst-case scenario, the economy remains on a measly path. As one business leader suggested, the increase to the minimum wage and increased taxes could mean ""everyone will just not hire - there's nothing to create confidence for us when we desperately need it.""

The Treasury might hope something else turns up and the long-term picture improves, perhaps because of advances in AI, perhaps because of planning reforms, perhaps because of, who knows. But the official predictions at the moment do not make for reassuring reading.

Lastly, decisions in the Budget might bash the public's trust in the government even further.

That's not just because having repeatedly promised not to increase income taxes, the chancellor is doing precisely that by freezing the level where you start paying tax, breaking certainly the spirit if not the precise letter of the party's election manifesto. And Reeves also stands 

accused of lying about how short of cash the government really was in the run up to the Budget

.

Repeatedly, and unusually publicly, the chancellor talked about how changes to the financial picture would leave her with no choice but to take those pesky, difficult decisions, i.e. put your taxes up.

This impression was created over many weeks, so tax rises didn't come as a massive shock to you or the markets. Some leaks were accidental. Many briefings were deliberate, including suggestions just last week that the numbers from the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) had come in more or less at the last moment, looking 

more rosy than had been expected

.

Here's the rub. What we now know is that the OBR, which released this information late on Friday, had weeks before told Rachel Reeves that because more tax had come in, there wasn't actually a hole in her finances after all. The Conservatives have blasted her for ""lying"" about the numbers. Downing Street has flat-out denied that.

But even one Labour insider questions whether the government crossed the line: ""Everyone knows the game, but there's a line between rolling the pitch and simply misleading the public and the lobby.""

In the worst-case scenario, the very messy Budget process has damaged trust in the government even more, and given their opponents more reason to hurl accusations of bad faith and bad behaviour right in heir face.

Budgets can unravel spectacularly, fall apart before your eyes. That has not happened this week. Given how bad things have been for this government in the last few months, that fact alone will be a relief. And Labour has emerged with a sharper political identity that's relieved many in its rank and file. But that's not the same as pleasing the public.

The financial picture doesn't give much cheer. In the end, there may not be much economic comfort in the political comfort zone.

Budget days used to be symbolised by the chancellor of the exchequer smiling and holding aloft the famous Red Box outside Number 11. Inside is a red book that contains the measures to be read out in the Budget speech.

These days, however, it's a blue book that's in the spotlight. Or more precisely, a chunky chart-filled analysis of the Budget, assessing the cost of government policies, published by a team that sits in a far corner of the Ministry of Justice building - one that few people outside this closed world know much about.

Yet it's also a department that has extraordinary influence over economic policy.

Now a debate is bubbling about whether this small department, known as the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - and staffed mainly by young intellectuals and civil servants - is in fact too powerful, with claims from some that it is essentially half-running the government economic policy.

And indeed whether its chairman, Richard Hughes, a Harvard-educated former Treasury mandarin, has in fact become as important as the real chancellor.

Ahead of Wednesday's Budget, is the OBR really the tail wagging the Treasury dog?

Lou Haigh, a former Labour Cabinet minister, has called the OBR an ""unelected institution dictating the limits of government ambition"". And just last week the Trades Union Congress accused the ""unaccountable OBR"" of being a ""straitjacket on growth"".

So, ahead of Wednesday's Budget, is the OBR really the tail wagging the Treasury dog - and if so, could this partly be at Labour's own hand for having changed the department's role in the first place?

Under Labour: the OBR's true influence

Back in March, just after the Spring Statement, I asked Richard Hughes for his response to the critique that had been prevalent even then that the OBR is all-powerful.

His answer, tinged with an uncharacteristic air of exasperation, was firm.

""The only powers we have are the ones given to us by Parliament in legislation,"" he insisted. ""And those are the powers to produce a forecast, to scrutinise the cost of government policies and to assess whether the chancellor is on the course to meet her fiscal rules.

""The chancellor chooses the policies she wants to implement. She chooses the rules she set for herself, and if she wants to change those rules, she can change those rules. If she wants to change the policies, she can change the policies.""

A debate is bubbling about whether the department, known to few outside this closed world, is in fact too powerful

Officially the OBR monitors the UK government's spending plans and performance, and releases forecasts for the economy and public finances twice a year, (alongside the Budget and Spring Statement), which assess whether the government is likely to meet the rules it has set over tax and spending.

Yet the irony in the timing of the questions around its influence is that they follow the chancellor herself giving the forecaster even more independence and authority. 

What's more, she herself appoints, with the consent of the Treasury Select Committee, the three members of the Budget Responsibility Committee, who lead the OBR.

When Labour entered office in 2024 it passed a new law giving it new powers to initiate forecasts, even when the government does not ask it to. This was prompted by the Conservatives' mini-Budget of September 2022, which promised big tax cuts but did not say how they would be paid for, and spooked financial markets.

At the time I reported that the then-Chancellor Kwasi Kwarteng had brushed away the offer from the OBR of an official forecast, which could either have given some comfort to the markets that the plan had been fully costed, or impeded the Truss administration's ability to announce those policy changes. The new law ensures this could not happen again. 

It also gives the OBR the ability to question government assumptions about spending by departments, which it did not have before, and provides direct access to Treasury data to help them do this.

Empowering the OBR was, in fact, part of Rachel Reeves's plan. 

The Chancellor believed that giving the forecaster more independence and influence would improve credibility in UK tax and spending policy; the memories of the Truss-Kwarteng mini-Budget may well have been front of mind.

And yet by September of this year, suggestions of the Treasury's own reported frustrations with the OBR were circulating.

When I asked the chancellor about a statement from the OBR, issued two months earlier, that ""promises made are constantly not kept"" on tax and spending, Reeves replied: ""The OBR have got an important job to do and their job is to produce forecasts on the economy - not to give a running commentary on government policy.""

Office for Budget Responsibility

Richard Hughes, the former Treasury mandarin, educated at Oxford and Harvard, is at the helm of the OBR

Yet the message I received from that exchange with Richard Hughes was clear: the OBR's true power is not at all at the level its critics suggest.

Warnings about a 'fiscal technocracy'

Even before Labour's law change, the then-director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, Paul Johnson, argued that we should be ""highly cautious"" about moving towards what he described as a ""more powerful fiscal technocracy"".

""The OBR has brought discipline and transparency to the fiscal policymaking process, but it is possible to have too much of a good thing,"" he claimed. ""Choices over how much to tax, spend and borrow are not narrow, technical questions. 

""They are inescapably political.""

At the end of October, one month before the Budget, the OBR is understood to have lowered its forecast for productivity - a measure of the output of the economy per hour worked - by 0.3 percentage points. Productivity plays a key role in long-term growth prospects and therefore can influence Budget decisions. 

According to the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, for every 0.1 percentage point downgrade in the productivity forecast, government borrowing would increase by £7bn in 2029-30 - meaning a 0.3 point cut could add £21bn to Rachel Reeves's Budget black hole.

This all has knock-on consequences for any chancellor. 

For example, if this downgrade had been given when, say, Jeremy Hunt was chancellor, it would have been far more difficult - impossible says the current Treasury - for the Conservatives to deliver the pre-election National Insurance cuts that he did in March 2024.

But the bigger issue is how much credit the government should get for ""pro-growth measures"", such as planning reform or easier post-Brexit trade terms with Europe. The more this is forecast to help medium-term growth, the smaller the gap in the Budget maths.

Debates have been emerging long before Wednesday's Budget

Some on the Labour left have identified the OBR as a core structural reason why a government with a massive majority cannot act decisively on its instincts. A version of that view has spread now to some on the Labour right too.

Praful Nargund, director of the Good Growth Foundation, who unsuccessfully stood against Jeremy Corbyn in last year's general election, said last week: ""The Office for Budget Responsibility was created to enforce austerity. But in its attempt to restore credibility, it has pushed us further down the spending-cut rabbit hole without an end in sight.

""A body designed to police cuts is now being asked to referee a strategy for growth, and it simply isn't built for the task.""

But Richard Hughes told me in March he was simply accounting for the numbers, and that it is the chancellor and Parliament that have £3 trillion a year worth of power to make decisions on either raising revenues or spending them.

A need for 'reconstruction'

In late September 2008, as the world and Britain especially was convulsed by its biggest ever financial crisis, the Conservative Party published an obscure pamphlet titled ""Reconstruction"".

British building society Bradford & Bingley had just been nationalised; US investment bank Lehman Brothers had collapsed a fortnight before; and half the British banking system was being prepared for state bailouts, and the pamphlet reflected what researchers were saying was best practice in the field of fiscal policy. 

It drew little attention, yet it was from this pamphlet that the idea of the OBR was born.

US investment bank Lehman Brothers collapsed in 2008

The office was first established by the coalition government in 2010, then put on a permanent statutory footing in March 2011. 

Yet Chancellor George Osborne predicted that appointing independent economists was going to cause the coalition government some problems. 

Take the fallout after Robert Chote, then chair of the OBR, published a chart showing spending levels at their lowest since the 1930s. 

It prompted my BBC colleague Norman Smith to describe the ""road-to-Wigan-pier"" style austerity, (a reference to the George Orwell's indictment of living conditions in the industrial north of England).

Chancellor George Osborne predicted that appointing independent economists was likely going to cause the coalition government some problems

Since then, the former Prime Minister Liz Truss, has made claims that a ""deep state"" played a part in bringing down her brief government - ""the economic establishment, who fundamentally don't want the status quo to change"", as she put it.

As for the OBR, she once said: ""Treasury officials go from the Treasury to the Bank of England, to the OBR to the Resolution Foundation. They go to Goldman Sachs, they… it's the same people.""

During the Johnson-Sunak era, the OBR also published charts that the sitting government would not have welcomed, which showed the tax burden reaching post-World War Two highs.

It is the Labour government that strengthened the OBR - and the distinguished CVs of the three members of the Budget Responsibility Committee ensure that it is taken seriously. 

Richard Hughes (left), Andy King, who was a member of the Budget Responsibility Committee of the Office for Budget Responsibility until August 2023, and David Miles (right)

Richard Hughes and Tom Josephs both had senior positions in charge of fiscal policy at the Treasury, while Prof David Miles is a former member of the Bank of England's monetary policy committee and chief economist at Morgan Stanley.

A tax rise speculation hamster wheel

Insiders have told me there will be important changes to how the dynamic between the OBR and the Treasury will function in future. 

In essence, the OBR's judgement of the amount of room for manoeuvre - the so-called ""headroom"" calculation - will now only be made once a year, from this Budget onwards. So, the tense process of the Treasury waiting on every bit of number crunching from the OBR will happen only in the run up to a full Budget.

It is a recognition that the current system has led to an ever-spinning hamster wheel of tax rise speculation.

However, defenders of the OBR say it is not the fault of the forecaster. And the International Monetary Fund (IMF) advises the UK that raising the headroom is the best way to stop the doom loop of tax-rise speculation harming consumer and business sentiment. 

The chancellor has all but announced her strategy to increase headroom figures at the Budget. The amount will be closely watched in the markets.

By September of this year, suggestions of the Treasury's own frustration with the OBR were circulating

Ultimately, the mini-Budget of 2022 showed how much the OBR's role is respected in the markets: this was stressed by the Bank of England governor Andrew Bailey at emergency meetings in Downing Street at the height of that crisis.

Plus, even if the OBR did not exist, the government's Budget decisions would still be constrained by the reaction of markets. 

The UK is, after all, reliant on the ""kindness of strangers"" - foreign buyers of our debt. As the Chancellor points out now, they are increasingly likely these days to be a foreign hedge fund than a UK pension or insurance company. 

So, those who now want to diminish the role of the OBR, will have to demonstrate alternative and convincing means of proving their own credibility, both on the numbers and on their political authority to drive through policies.

And yet other countries do manage without institutions such as this. So, for now, there is a serious debate emerging at this Budget, not just about the Chancellor's policies. The role, record, and future of the OBR is definitively in play.

The residents of Peckham in south London have just lost their Poundland store, which closed this week after 11 years of trading.

""Everyone comes in here, it's very cheap. I buy stuff for my kids, snacks, toiletries,"" says passing shopper Becky Cullen, staring at the empty shop. ""It was always busy... Where are we going to shop now?""

The store was on Rye Lane, a lively high street where Caribbean grocers stack yams next to beauty and phone repair shops. There are bars, cafes and the odd hip vintage shop. But Peckham still has high levels of deprivation and as such it is just the sort of place where a bargain shop should be booming in a cost-of-living crisis.

Instead Poundland has found itself running a store closure programme as it tries to secure its future on the high street.

Rye Lane in south London - a lively, multicultural high street - is losing its pound shop, after 11 years of trading

More than 100 of its shops have either shut or been earmarked for closure since the summer. That's after the business was sold in June for a nominal £1 amid ""challenging trading conditions"".

It does have a turnaround plan but by the end of the process, Poundland expects to end up with between 650 and 700 shops, compared with the 800-odd it had at the start of this year.

Elsewhere on UK high streets, the Original Factory shop is struggling and has shut at least 22 shops. Maxideal, a small discount chain, has closed altogether. And B&M Bargains, one of the UK's biggest discount chains, has launched a turnaround plan due to weak sales.

These places should in theory be the destinations of choice for people who are trying to spend less on everyday goods, or trading down from more expensive shops. 

So why - in an age where so many of us are feeling the financial pinch - are some of these budget shops that are household names having such a tough time?

Are shoppers 'outsmarting' budget stores?

One thing is clear - we're not falling out of love with budget shopping, far from it. But the way we are budget shopping does appear to have changed.

""[Shoppers] are outsmarting the budget shops,"" says retail expert Catherine Shuttleworth, whose company, Savvy, gathers insight on shopper behaviour. ""[They're doing this] by saying, 'These are things I'm going to buy from you.' 

""They know their prices inside out."" 

Sometimes shoppers will take a photo of a deal on their phone and send it to their friends and family, she says, so that everyone is up-to-date with the latest prices.

But that's not the only challenge. Budget chains are also experiencing a formidable combination of rising costs and competition.

Poundland was sold in June for a nominal £1 amid 'challenging trading conditions'

All big retailers have faced a substantial increase in employer costs because of last year's Budget, but it's more difficult when you're selling the cheapest products because there's less wiggle room to absorb the extra costs, or to pass them on to customers.

For pound shops in particular, it's even harder to make the business model work today, as a pound isn't what it used to be. 

After inflation, selling a product for £1 in 1990, when Poundland began, is the equivalent of selling it for 40p today.

The entrepreneur who cracked the model

Chris Edwards, a businessman from Yorkshire, has spent more than 50 years working in retail's bargain basement. He and his son were the team behind Poundworld, which they sold for £150m 10 years ago.

In 2019, they started a new chain, OneBelow, selling everything for £1 or less - but three years later they had to change tactics. It's now called OneBeyond, with almost everything at £1 or above.

""We realised the pound game wasn't going to work any more,"" he says. ""What tipped us over the edge was the [post-pandemic] shipping crisis, when we couldn't get containers through and the cost of freight was ridiculous.""

'We realised the pound game wasn't going to work any more,' says Chris Edwards

But Mr Edwards says his business model still works: in his view, it comes down to experience, negotiating skill and getting the mix of products just right.

His Croydon store, with a colourful Christmas aisle, is bustling on a weekend visit with queues for the tills as shoppers stock up on mouthwash, washing up liquid, sweets and batteries.

""We know what the customer is going to buy before the customer knows they're going to buy it,"" he declares.

As for making economics stack up, he says sometimes he is able to secure cheap prices on UK stock from big-name brands but when he can't he sacrifices profits in order to attract shoppers.

Budget shops place a huge value on the Christmas period, says retail expert Catherine Shuttleworth

""We've got a constant flow of containers from China and we can negotiate very keen prices,"" he says.

So, if customers enter a store to buy a Coca-Cola, they may also pick up a product imported directly from China, where he can make a bit of ""extra margin"".

When the numbers unravel

If you don't get budget retail right though, the numbers can quickly unravel.

The father and son duo grew Poundworld into a chain of more than 300 shops, before selling it in 2015 to an American investor. But it soon collapsed, disappearing from the high street three years later.

""They just didn't understand the discount business,"" he argues. ""They tried to sell other things but not in a controlled way like we do it.""

Wilko also lost its way, tipping into administration in 2023 with the loss of thousands of jobs.

Poundland avoided collapsing into administration this year, after a dreadful period of trading, much of it of its own making. 

The business had drifted further and further from its original premise - lots of products for £1 - and was selling them instead at a wide range of different prices. 

Its owners, the Warsaw-listed Pepco Group, also put Pepco clothing into Poundland stores, which wasn't popular with shoppers.

""Poundland forgot what they were. The key to budget shops is keeping them simple,"" says Catherine Shuttleworth.

But she believes Poundland can find its way back, providing they return to basics. The company has already simplified its pricing and says it is making good progress with a turnaround plan.

This has meant closing 57 unprofitable stores and negotiating steep rent cuts with landlords, where it can. Another 48 shops are being shut as these landlords have decided to take back the leases and find new occupiers instead.

The main budget chains now have 3,400 shops across the UK, according to data analytics firm, Geolytix. The number of them more than doubled between 2009 and 2015 - but numbers have risen only slightly since then.

Back in 2009 the UK was in the teeth of a recession, following the global financial crisis. Woolworths had just disappeared, giving rivals, such as Poundland, the chance to fill the gaps, taking advantage of cheap rents. 

And shoppers, everywhere, were after bargains.

High street shopping has evolved since the 1970s, when shops like Woolworths were hugely popular

Discount supermarkets Aldi and Lidl also grew rapidly during this period, luring millions of customers away from the established grocers with cheaper prices. Savvy shopping became cool, even for those on higher incomes.

By 2019, much of the budget store growth was happening in out-of-town locations and retail parks, a trend accelerated by the pandemic. For instance, B&M, Home Bargain and The Range shops have large garden centres and sell bulkier items which are easier to collect by car.

But budget shops are having a much tougher time during this cost-of-living crisis. 

Not only have the supermarkets upped their game with sharper prices and loyalty cards to keep shoppers on board, but the sector also now has the rise of ""extreme discounting"" online to contend with.

From China to TikTok: growing competition

Today, Chinese players Shein and Temu are nibbling away on the budget shops' patch by selling ultra-cheap products direct to consumers. There's also AliExpress, another Chinese-based retailer, which operates as a global online market connecting shoppers with sellers.

""AliExpress had a huge boost in usership last year, from sponsoring the Euros, and it's growing,"" says Nick Carroll, director of retail insight from Mintel.

Sales figures are hard to come by, but Mintel data suggests 30% of online shoppers in the UK shopped with Temu in the year to September 2025, while 14% shopped with AliExpress and 3% with DHGate, another Chinese marketplace, in the same period.

Chinese brands like Shein sell products in bulk from their huge factories - inside one of their enormous factories

Amazon has also got in on the act by launching its own ultra-low-cost shopping section, Amazon Haul.

""If you look at those products, they look very similar to what you'd find on Temu etc, so if Amazon's doing a reaction to something in the market, you know it's notable,"" says Mr Carroll.

""There's a lot more coming into that space. So this sort of wave of low-cost influence from outside of the UK isn't slowing down, and I think there's much more to come.""

There are also new selling platforms like TikTok Shop, Catherine Shuttleworth points out, where you can find people advertising anything from sweets and toilet paper to pillows. A seller on TikTok can sell toilet paper cheaper than a high street shop, she adds, because there are no overheads, no staff, and probably very little stock.

""As long as they [shoppers] can get it at the right price, the right place and at the right time, they will go anywhere to do that,"" she says. 

""It's not just the standard retailer they used to go to - it could be anybody.""

The danger for traditional budget shops is that they will no longer be seen as being the cheapest in the market.

All this coupled with a ""cost-of-business crisis"" - caused by recent rises in the minimum wage and in employers' national insurance contributions, among other things - could shake out the weaker players, thinks Ms Shuttleworth.

""You've got to be the best of the best in whichever segment, whether you're at the top, the middle or the bottom, and it's super-super-competitive and one of the problems here, is there's so many people in that market.

""But I think what will happen in this sector is that there has to be some consolidation, and the stronger players will win out.""

Lessons from the outliers

It's not all bad news, of course. Some chains have been doing very well recently.

The Range has continued to expand, opening 60 standalone stores this year, after acquiring the DIY chain Homebase out of administration. Home Bargains is still thriving and opening new stores, too.

Savers, which sells mostly toiletries and cosmetics, but some other goods too, has also expanded in recent years. The BBC has been told it is moving into Poundland's Peckham store space.

OneBeyond has grown to 132 stores, but expansion has slowed. Chris Edwards blames the government, arguing it has made things harder by piling on extra costs.

""Every period has its own challenges... and we just have to do our own thing.""

As for current trading, he says, he is getting by. ""We're not saying we're earning fortunes of money. We're not - but we're paying our way, and we're just waiting for better times.""

'We can break even all year if we have a good Halloween and a good Christmas'

His focus now, along with almost every other retailer, is Christmas trading. 

""It means everything... we can break even all year if we have a good Halloween and a good Christmas,"" he says.

Catherine Shuttleworth reckons that's where good budget retailers come into their own, as shoppers often turn to these aisles for big events. ""They're a great place to go and deck your house out.""

But also, they may be the only place many households can afford to shop. Not everyone likes to shop online, or wants to make the trip to a retail park.

""For some people, budget shopping is a hobby,"" she adds, ""but for others it's an absolute necessity.""

After a year that began with action in Venezuela and a trip to Davos, President Donald Trump is turning his attention back to the domestic economy. 

On Tuesday, Trump made a planned trip to Iowa to speak about affordability. The White House billed the speech as a campaign-style event and intended it to kick off the run-up to the midterm elections in November, rallying Trump's base.

The US negotiators will be led by special envoy Steve Witkoff (left), while the Iranian team is headed by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi

Senior US and Iranian officials are expected to meet in Oman later for direct talks amid a crisis that has raised fears of a military confrontation between the two countries.

The discussions come after a US military build-up in the Middle East in response to Iran's violent repression of nationwide anti-government protests last month, that human rights groups say killed many thousands of people.

Uncertainty over the location and scope had threatened to derail the talks, which are part of a diplomatic effort by regional mediators to de-escalate tensions.

Both countries remain far apart in their positions. The hope is that, if successful, the discussions could lead to a framework for negotiations.

The US, which is demanding Iran freezes its nuclear programme and discards its stockpile of enriched uranium, had said the talks should also involve Iran's ballistic missiles, the country's support for regional armed groups and its treatment of its citizens. 

Iran, however, has said the discussions will be limited to its nuclear programme, and it is unclear if these differences have been resolved.

In recent weeks, President Donald Trump has threatened to bomb Iran if it does not reach a deal. The US has sent thousands of troops and what Trump has described as an ""armada"" to the region, including an aircraft carrier along with other warships as well as fighter jets. 

Iran has vowed to respond to an attack with force, threatening to strike American military assets in the Middle East and Israel.

The Iranian delegation will be led by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, who last week said his country's armed forces were ""with their fingers on the trigger"", while the US will be represented by special envoy Steve Witkoff and Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner. 

Watch: Iran's supreme leader 'should be very worried' amid tensions, Trump says

This will be the first meeting involving US and Iranian officials since the war between Israel and Iran last June, when the US bombed Iran's three main nuclear facilities. 

Iran says its uranium enrichment activity stopped after the attacks.

For Iran's embattled leaders, the talks could be the last chance to avert US military action that could further destabilise the regime, which analysts say is in its weakest position since it came to power following the 1979 Islamic Revolution.

Trump's threats came as Iran's security forces brutally repressed large-scale demonstrations, which were triggered by a deepening economic crisis, and saw protesters calling for the end of the Islamic Republic. 

The Human Rights Activists News Agency, a Washington-based group, said it had confirmed at least 6,883 deaths, warning that the number could be much higher, and that more than 50,000 people had been arrested.

The current crisis has brought back to discussions the issue of Iran's nuclear programme, which has been at the centre of a long-running dispute with the West. 

For decades, Iran has said its programme is for peaceful purposes, while the US and Israel have accused it of being part of an effort to develop a weapon.

Iran says it has the right to enrich uranium in its own territory and has rejected calls for its stockpile of highly enriched uranium - 400kg (880lb) - to be transferred to a third country. 

Officials have indicated being open to concessions, which could include the creation of a regional consortium for uranium enrichment, as proposed during talks with the US that collapsed when Israel launched its surprise war last year.

At the same time, Iran says demands to limit the country's ballistic missile programme and to end the support for proxies in the region - an alliance Tehran calls the ""Axis of Resistance"" that includes Hamas in Gaza, militias in Iraq, Hezbollah in Lebanon and the Houthis in Yemen - are unacceptable and a breach of its sovereignty.

On Tuesday, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said he had instructed Araghchi to ""pursue fair and equitable negotiations"" with the US, ""provided that a suitable environment exists"". 

In any case, Iran is expected to demand the lifting of sanctions that have crippled its economy. Opponents of the regime say any relief would give the clerical rulers a lifeline.

For the US, the meeting, depending on its outcome, could offer an offramp for Trump from his military threats. 

Regional countries are concerned that a US strike could lead to a wider conflict or long-term chaos in Iran, and have warned that air power alone will not be able to topple the Iranian leadership.

Asked if Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei should be worried, Trump told NBC News on Wednesday: ""I would say he should be very worried. Yeah, he should be"".

US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the discussions would have to go beyond the nuclear issue for ""something meaningful"" to be achieved. 

""I'm not sure you can reach a deal with these guys, but we're going to try to find out. We don't see there's any harm in trying to figure out if there's something that can be done,"" he said.

The talks, initially planned to be held in Istanbul, are an effort led by Egypt, Turkey and Qatar to defuse tensions. 

Iran, however, asked at the last minute for the location of the meeting to be changed to Oman, which hosted discussions last year, and for it to be limited to Iranian and American officials.

Sir Keir Starmer says sorry to Epstein victims for appointing Mandelson

Sir Keir Starmer has apologised to the victims of Jeffrey Epstein for believing Lord Mandelson's ""lies"" and appointing him as the UK's ambassador to the US.

The prime minister began a planned speech on funding to improve local communities by addressing the growing anger over how he had dealt with the issue.

While he acknowledged it had been publicly known for some time that Lord Mandelson knew Epstein, he said: ""None of us knew the depths and the darkness of that relationship.""

However, Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch said the PM's position was ""untenable"", while the Liberal Democrats called for a confidence vote to see if Labour MPs supported him.

The prime minister is facing calls from some of his own MPs to stand down. 

While the handful of backbenchers to do so publicly are frequent critics of the PM, many more have raised concerns privately.

Sir Keir's former political director Luke Sullivan said he thought the PM was ""fighting for his premiership"".

He 

told the BBC's Newscast

: ""I don't think you can understate how serious the situation and the peril is that the prime minister finds himself in.""

Seeking to defuse the row in a speech earlier, Sir Keir said he regretted appointing Lord Mandelson and would not have done so if he had known what he knows now.

Directly addressing Epstein's victims, he said:  ""I am sorry, sorry for what was done to you, sorry that so many people with power failed you. Sorry for having believed Mandelson's lies and appointed him and sorry that even now you're forced to watch this story unfold in public once again.""

Reacting to Sir Keir's apology, Epstein survivor Marina Lacerda said: ""I have to commend him for going on national television and admitting he was wrong and apologising to us.""

Speaking to the BBC's Newsnight, she said: ""I think that's a huge step, right. You have also people here in America that have not even tried to apologise to us. 

""So I have to commend him for that.""

Watch: I have to commend Starmer for apologising, says Epstein survivor Marina Lacerda

Sir Keir has promised to release files, which he says will prove Lord Mandelson lied about the extent of his friendship with Epstein when he was being vetted for the US ambassador role.

The government was forced into a climbdown by Labour backbenchers, after it had planned to withhold some sensitive material. 

After a Commons vote, the government will pass documents which could damage national security or diplomatic relations to Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee (ISC), rather than withholding them.

The ISC says the government should decide which documents are made public - and which are not.

They say this will be done by the cabinet secretary, with an expectation the documents are laid before parliament ""very shortly"".

At the time Lord Mandelson was appointed as US ambassador in December 2024, it was public knowledge that he had maintained a friendship with Epstein after his conviction for soliciting sex from a minor.

In 2023, the Financial Times reported emails suggesting he stayed at Epstein's Manhattan mansion in 2009, while the financier was in jail.

The PM said Lord Mandelson was asked directly about the nature of his relationship with Epstein before he was appointed as ambassador, whether he had stayed at his home after his conviction and whether he had accepted gifts and hospitality from him.

""The information now available makes clear that the answers he gave were lies,"" he said.

""He portrayed Epstein as someone he barely knew.

""And when that became clear and it was not true, I sacked him.""

The BBC understands Lord Mandelson's view is that he answered questions about his relationship with Epstein in the vetting process accurately.

Could this be the beginning of the end for Starmer?

What was the vetting process for Mandelson's appointment as US ambassador?

Who is Peter Mandelson?

Challenged after his speech over whether he should stand down as PM, Sir Keir said he understood the ""anger and frustration amongst Labour MPs"" over Lord Mandelson.

However, he added: ""I was elected on a mandate in 2024 to change the country for the better... that's what I intend to do.""

Labour MP Rachael Maskell told BBC Radio York Sir Keir's position was ""untenable"" he had ""no choice"" but to step down.

Meanwhile, Paula Barker, who represents Liverpool Wavertree, said the PM ""has shown that his judgement is questionable"".

""I think he has a very long way to build trust and confidence with public and trust and confidence within our party as a whole,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme.

Jonathan Hinder, the MP for Pendle and Clitheroe, said the PM's decision to appoint Lord Mandelson as US ambassador was a ""catastrophic error of political and moral judgement"".

He called on Sir Keir to speak to Labour MPs in person and acknowledge this.

Sir Keir has also faced calls to sack his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney, who was close to Lord Mandelson and widely thought to have lobbied for his appointment.

Karl Turner, Labour MP for Kingston upon Hull East, said the PM had been given ""shoddy"" advice over the appointment.

Reuters

Lord Mandelson was sacked as US ambassador last September

He told the BBC he did not want a new prime minister but called on Sir Keir to ""get a grip"" and for McSweeney to go.

Downing Street has insisted the PM has full confidence in his chief of staff.

Lord Mandelson was sacked last September, following the emergence of new emails revealing supportive messages he sent to Epstein after he pleaded guilty to sex offences.

In recent days, more documents released by the US Department of Justice have laid bare the extent of their relationship.

They include emails suggesting Epstein made payments worth thousands of pounds to Lord Mandelson and his partner.

Police are investigating allegations of misconduct in public office, after other emails in the files suggested Lord Mandelson forwarded on market-sensitive information to Epstein when he was business secretary during the financial crisis in 2009.

Lord Mandelson has not responded to requests for comment, but the BBC understands his position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain.

Keir Starmer was in Hastings to deliver a speech on local regeneration 

This is a very serious moment for Sir Keir Starmer.

Everything the prime minister has said and done today has reflected the fact that he and his team understand the gravity of his situation.

It would have felt odd and jarring had Sir Keir simply delivered the speech that he had been planning to deliver this morning about more funding to inspire pride in neighbourhoods.

So he didn't. 

The prime minister instead delivered an apology specifically to the victims of Jeffrey Epstein for having ""believed Mandelson's lies"" and appointed him to the UK's top diplomatic posting.

Arguably more telling was the moment when, under intense questioning from journalists, Sir Keir conceded that he understood the ""anger and frustration of Labour MPs"".

It is Labour MPs who will determine the prime minister's fate and they are more furious than they have ever been during his leadership right now.

Labour MP Rachael Maskell, who has been a thorn in Sir Keir's side over welfare cuts, has said she thinks his position as prime minister is ""untenable"" and it is ""inevitable"" that he will have to stand down.

She told BBC Radio York: ""I don't believe he's got a choice.

""He kept from the House [of Commons] for several months the fact that he knew of the associations between Peter Mandelson and Jeffrey Epstein at the point of appointment.""

This was a ""dishonourable thing to do"" to MPs, as well as Epstein's victims, she added.

Live:  Anger among Labour MPs grows over Starmer's handling of Mandelson-Epstein scandal

'I never left your side': Emails reveal more about Mandelson's Epstein friendship

What was the vetting process for Mandelson's appointment as US ambassador?

Another Labour MP, who did not want to be named, told BBC Radio 5 Live's Matt Chorley: ""I have to say, I don't see how he can carry on.""

""It's been terminal for months,"" added another, ""but the patient has now stopped responding to treatment.""

A Labour minister said: ""The only thing that is certain is that the government is not in control of this and so it could go anywhere.""

Others Matt spoke to were more supportive of the PM, with Rugby MP John Slinger saying: ""Calm heads need to prevail. The PM has done the right thing here."" 

Steve Witherden told BBC Wales: ""At the very least, the prime minister's chief of staff, Mr [Morgan] McSweeney, clearly has to answer why he pushed for Mandelson's appointment despite details of his relationship with Epstein being publicly known.""

However, it is telling that for all the off the record anger, few MPs are calling for the prime minister to go in public. 

The small handful who have so far are MPs who have never much supported his leadership.

In fact, there are not even many MPs willing to call publicly for McSweeney to be sacked, something Sir Keir has resisted doing.

That suggests that while the prime minister is weaker than ever, a challenge to his leadership is far from imminent.

""Realistically I don't think something can happen until post-Gorton"", one MP said, referring to the Gorton and Denton by-election on 26 February. 

""And then it might be too close to May,"" when elections are being held in Scotland, Wales and some English local authorities.

A former minister said: ""I still think it is very unlikely anybody moves before May. But it is all moving very fast."" 

They added: ""I don't see how the PM recovers from the utter lapse in judgment in appointing Mandelson.""

A current minister said: ""He's done. It's just a question of when.""

One night in 2023, Eric was scrolling on a social media channel he regularly browsed for porn. Seconds into a video, he froze.

He realised the couple he was watching - entering the room, setting down their bags, and later, having sex - was himself and his girlfriend. Three weeks earlier, they had spent the night in a hotel in Shenzhen, southern China, unaware that they were not alone.

Their most intimate moments had been captured by a camera hidden in their hotel room, and the footage made available to thousands of strangers who had logged in to the channel Eric himself used to access pornography.

Eric (not his real name) was no longer just a consumer of China's spy-cam porn industry, but a victim.

Warning: This story contains some offensive language

So-called spy-cam porn has existed in China for at least a decade, despite the fact that producing and distributing porn is illegal in the country.

But in the past couple of years the issue has become a regular talking point on social media, with people - particularly women - swapping tips on how to spot cameras as small as a pencil eraser. Some have even resorted to pitching tents inside hotel rooms to avoid being filmed.

Last April, new government regulations attempted to stem this epidemic - requiring hotel owners to check regularly for hidden cameras.

But the threat of being secretly filmed in the privacy of a hotel room has not gone away. The BBC World Service has found thousands of recent spy-cam videos filmed in hotel rooms and sold as porn, on multiple sites.

Outside the UK, watch the film 

on YouTube

 or listen to the Podcast 

here

Much of the material is advertised on the messaging and social media app Telegram. Over 18 months, I discovered six different websites and apps promoted on Telegram. Between them these claimed to operate more than 180 hotel-room spy-cams which were not just capturing, but livestreaming, hotel guests' activities.

I monitored one of these websites regularly for seven months and found content captured by 54 different cameras, with about half operational at any one time.

That means thousands of guests could have been filmed over that period, the BBC estimates, based on typical occupancy rates. Most are unlikely to know they have been captured on camera.

Eric, from Hong Kong, began watching secretly filmed videos as a teenager, attracted by how ""raw"" the footage was.

""What drew me in is the fact that the people don't know they're being filmed,"" says Eric, now in his 30s. ""I think traditional porn feels very staged, very fake.""

But he experienced what it feels like to be at the opposite end of the supply chain when he found the video of himself and his girlfriend ""Emily"" - and he no longer finds gratification in this content.

When he broke the news to Emily that their hotel stay had been filmed, edited into an hour-long clip, and uploaded to Telegram, she thought he was joking. But then she saw the footage for herself and was mortified.

Emily was terrified the clip could have been seen by colleagues and family. The couple didn't talk to each other for weeks.

So how does the industry - which exploits unsuspecting couples' intimate sexual acts for voyeuristic paying customers - work, and who is behind it?

One of the most prominent spy-cam porn traders I came across was an agent known as ""AKA"".

Posing as a consumer, I paid to access one of the livestreaming websites promoted by him - for a monthly fee of 450 Yuan ($65, £47).

Once logged in, I had the option to choose between five different filming feeds, each showing several hotel rooms - visible as soon as a guest triggered the electricity supply by inserting their key card. It was also possible to rewind livestreams from the start, and download archived clips.

The spy-cam livestreams show clear views of hotel beds 

On Telegram - banned in China but commonly used for illicit activity - AKA advertised these livestreams. One Telegram channel had as many as 10,000 members during the course of our investigation.

Libraries of his edited livestream clips are also available on Telegram for a flat fee. I could see more than 6,000 videos in the archive, dating back to 2017.

AKA's subscribers comment in Telegram's channel function, as they watch unsuspecting hotel guests - judging their appearance, gossiping about their conversations, and appraising their sexual performance.

They celebrate when a couple starts having sex - and complain if they switch the lights off, shrouding them in darkness. Women are regularly described as ""sluts"", ""whores"" and ""bitches"".

We managed to trace one of the spy-cams to a hotel room in Zhengzhou, central China, through piecing together several clues, from subscribers, social media users, and our own research.

Researchers on the ground were able to access the room, and found the camera - lens pointed at the bed - hidden in the wall ventilation unit and wired into the building's electricity supply.

Watch: The moment the BBC finds a spy-cam hidden in a hotel room

A hidden-camera detector, widely sold online as a ""must-have"" for hotel guests, gave no warning they were being spied on.

The team disabled the secret camera and word spread quickly on Telegram.

""Zhonghua [name of the camera] got taken down!"" one subscriber wrote on the main channel managed by AKA.

""It's such a shame; that room has the best sound quality!"" AKA responded in the chat.

But the complaints turned to celebration when, within hours, AKA posted that a replacement camera in a different hotel had been activated.

""This is the speed of… [our livestreaming platform],"" AKA told his subscribers. ""Impressive right?""

During our 18-month investigation we identified about a dozen agents like AKA.

The exchanges they had with subscribers made it clear they were working for others higher up the supply chain, who they referred to as ""camera owners"". These people, the agents' comments suggested, arranged the spy-cam installation and managed the livestreaming platforms.

During our direct messaging with AKA, he accidentally shared a screenshot of a message from someone he said was a ""camera owner"", with the profile name ""Brother Chun"".

AKA quickly deleted the message, and refused to discuss it, but we managed to contact ""Brother Chun"" directly. Despite our evidence that he supplied the livestreaming website to AKA, Brother Chun claimed he was just another sales agent, although he did seem to acknowledge the supply chain extended beyond people like himself.

What is clear is there are significant sums of money to be made. Based on channel membership and subscription fees, the BBC estimates AKA alone has earned at least 163,200 Yuan ($22,000, £16,300) since last April. The average annual income in China last year was 43,377 Yuan ($6,200, £4,600) according to China's Bureau of Statistics.

Eric and Emily never go out without wearing hats now, for fear they might be recognised 

There are strict rules on selling and using spy-cams in China, but we found it relatively easy to buy one in the country's largest electronics market in Huaqiangbei.

Accurate figures on how many people have been brought before the courts for spy-cam porn are more difficult to find. China's authorities have shared far fewer legal case details in recent years, but the cases we found ranged the length of China - from Jilin province in the north, to Guangdong in the far south.

Blue Li, from a Hong Kong-based NGO called RainLily - which helps victims remove explicit secretly-filmed footage from the internet - says demand is rising for her group's services, but the task is proving more difficult.

Telegram never responds to RainLily's requests for removal, she says, forcing them to contact group administrators - the very people selling or sharing spy-cam pornography - who have little incentive to respond.

""We believe tech companies share the huge responsibility in addressing these problems. Because these companies are not neutral platforms; their policies shape how the content would be spread,"" Li says.

The BBC itself told Telegram, via its report function, that AKA and Brother Chun - and the groups they managed - were sharing spy-cam porn via its platforms, but it did not respond or take any action.

Contacted again 10 days later, with the BBC's full investigation findings, Telegram told us: ""Sharing non-consensual pornography is explicitly forbidden by Telegram's terms of service"" and ""it proactively moderates… and accepts reports [of inappropriate content] in order to remove millions of pieces of harmful content each day.""

We formally set out our findings to Brother Chun and AKA that they were profiting from exploiting unsuspecting hotel guests. They did not reply, but hours later the Telegram accounts they used to advertise the content appeared to have been deleted. However the website that AKA sold me access to is still livestreaming hotel guests.

Eric and Emily remain traumatised by their experience. They always wear hats in public in case they are recognised and try to avoid staying in hotels. Eric no longer uses these Telegram channels to watch porn, he says, but still checks them occasionally - terrified the clip could resurface.

The US has backed the UK's deal to hand over the Chagos Islands to Mauritius and lease back a key military base, Downing Street has told the BBC.

On Thursday, Donald Trump signalled his approval for the move, describing Sir Keir Starmer's agreement as the ""best he could make"".

It comes just a few weeks after the US president prompted fears in Whitehall that he would withdraw his support, after he branded the deal an ""act of great stupidity"".

Trump's comments led to additional talks between officials to confirm continued American support for the agreement, which will impact the future of a joint UK-US airbase. 

UK defends Chagos deal after Trump calls it 'act of great stupidity'

What is the UK's Chagos Islands deal and why has Trump criticised it?

The deal, originally announced last year, would see the UK transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands while leasing back 

the joint military base on the largest island, Diego Garcia

, for an initial 99 years.

During a conversation on Thursday, the two leaders ""agreed on the importance"" of the deal to secure the base, Downing Street said.

A spokeswoman said they agreed the UK and US would ""continue to work closely on the implementation of the deal"".

In a post on his Truth Social platform earlier on Thursday, Trump wrote that his discussions with Sir Keir had been ""very productive"".

He added: ""I understand that the deal Prime Minister Starmer has made, according to many, the best he could make.""

""However, if the lease deal, sometime in the future, ever falls apart, or anyone threatens or endangers US operations and forces at our base, I retain the right to militarily secure and reinforce the American presence in Diego Garcia,"" he said.

Asked about Trump's comments, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt told reporters: ""He spoke with Prime Minister Starmer directly, he understands Prime Minister Starmer's position - and he supports it.""

""But as the president reiterated in that statement, of course, the United States reserves the right to protect our assets."" 

Greenland row

Warren Stephens, the US's ambassador to the UK, said while the ""ideal"" outcome would be for the UK not to transfer sovereignty of the Chagos Islands, it was the ""best deal on the table for successive UK governments"".

Echoing the president, Stephens said the US ""retains the right to maintain and to reinforce our security interests on Diego Garcia if needed in the future"".

The deal was originally announced last year, and 

had been endorsed by Trump and US officials.

 But last month the US president labelled it an ""act of total weakness"".

He added in a post on Truth Social: ""The UK giving away extremely important land is an act of GREAT STUPIDITY, and is another in a very long line of National Security reasons why Greenland has to be acquired.""

Trump's criticism of the agreement came during an international row over his threats to take control of Greenland.

At the time, Sir Keir accused Trump of 

making the comments to pressure the UK

 over its support for the sovereignty of the Danish territory. 

The comments threw into doubt whether the US would continue to support the Chagos deal. At the time, Downing Street said it believed the US still supported it, despite the president's comments.

Officials in London and Washington have since been involved in talks to determine whether US support for the agreement still stood.

The BBC understands those talks, which included two direct phone calls between Starmer and Trump, have now been completed.

'Appalling surrender'

A draft law to ratify the Chagos Islands deal is making its way through Parliament but has been delayed since the president's outburst last month.

Sir Keir has insisted the deal is necessary to protect the continued operation of the base, amid previous attempts from Mauritius to dispute the legality of British sovereignty over the islands.

The deal has been heavily criticised by the Conservatives and Reform UK, who argue it undermines national security because of Mauritius's ties to China.

Conservative shadow foreign secretary, Dame Priti Patel, said Trump's statement ""recognises a critical weakness in the surrender deal"" about the lease arrangements.

""The Conservative Party's view is unchanged,"" she added. 

""We have led the fight against this appalling surrender and we will continue fighting it to the end.""

The number of refugee households who are homeless or at risk of homelessness increased by more than 15,000 in four years, figures show

There has been a five-fold increase in the number of refugee households who are homeless or at risk of homelessness in the last four years, the BBC has found.

Government data for England showed a rise from 3,560 in 2021/22, to 19,310 in 2024/25.

Charities said the increase was a ""direct result"" of government policy, and blamed the 28-day period newly-recognised refugees are given to move out of Home Office accommodation - including hotels - as well as faster processing of claims by asylum seekers.

The government said it was ""committed"" to helping refugees transition from asylum housing to their own accommodation and was working with local authorities ""to mitigate the risk of homelessness"".

It comes as successive governments have struggled to get a grip on the UK's overwhelmed asylum system, with a huge backlog of people waiting for decisions on claims and appeals.

Processing had been slow and, at one point put on pause entirely, but Labour wants to speed up decisions - resulting in more people being granted refugee status and looking for somewhere to live.

One charity supporting homeless refugees said it was mostly seeing young women under the age of 30 asking for help.

Yusra, who arrived in the UK on a small boat after fleeing war in Sudan, is among them. The 26-year-old said her entire family was killed before she arrived in the UK.

She was placed in a government-funded asylum hotel for about five months but said, since she was granted refugee status in late August, she had been sleeping in a tent on the streets of Greater Manchester.

""Sometimes drunk people come and try to open the tent and I start screaming,"" Yusra said. ""I can't sleep until the morning.""

In the days before she had to leave her Home Office accommodation, Yusra contacted her local council. However, as a single adult without children, she ranked as low priority for social housing.

Yusra told the BBC she fled Sudan for a better life but now regretted coming to the UK, saying life has been ""very difficult"" since becoming homeless.

She is one of many refugees receiving support from the Stockport Race Equality Partnership.

Once an asylum seeker is given refugee status they have 28 days to move out of government-funded accommodation - usually a house in multiple occupation (HMO) or a hotel - and find their own housing. At the same time, they must find work or, if necessary, apply for universal credit.

The government has said it usually takes about 35 days to receive an initial universal credit payment. As a result, charities have said many refugees are not able to secure housing or benefits before their asylum support ends.

Jasmine Basran, Head of Policy & Campaigns for national homelessness charity Crisis, said 28 days was not enough time for refugees to sort everything.

She said the charity was seeing the highest rise in homelessness among refugees and the true number without a home was likely to be even higher, as government data only counts those who notify their local authority.

According to the latest figures, London and the North West - including Manchester and Liverpool - have the highest proportion of refugees who are homeless or at risk of homelessness.

The west London borough of Hillingdon saw the sharpest increase - 2,098 homeless households in the area were refugees in 2024/25, up from 71 in 2021/22.

Refugees must seek support from an area they have a local connection to, which is often where their asylum accommodation is. Hillingdon houses a higher number of asylum seekers due to its proximity to Heathrow Airport.

In December, the National Audit Office 

released a damning report into the asylum system

, finding a succession of ""short-term, reactive"" government policies had moved problems elsewhere, increasing levels of homelessness.

Its criticisms highlighted changes to the 28-day move-on period, a drive to clear inherited asylum backlogs shifting pressure onto appeals, and a shortage of judges creating court backlogs.

Last year, the Labour government ran a pilot increasing the 28-day period for people granted asylum to 56 days, but this 

ended early

,

 in September, when it reverted back to 28 days

.

In 2023, for some refugees, that period shrunk to seven days after the government briefly changed how the move-on period was calculated. The policy was reversed, with the British Red Cross saying it had led to ""devastating levels of destitution"".

The 56 day move-on period pilot was, however, extended for those deemed vulnerable - including pregnant women, families with children and disabled people. It was due to end in January 2026, but is understood to still be in place.

It comes as the latest Home Office figures suggest 110,000 people claimed asylum in the year ending September 2025 - a 13% increase on the previous year.

As of September last year, there were 108,085 people in asylum accommodation, with more than 36,000 in hotels and the majority in shared housing, such as HMOs. Asylum accommodation contracts have cost the government billions of pounds.

The government has pledged to clear the backlog of asylum seekers waiting for their claim to be decided, to close ""every asylum hotel"" and cut asylum costs, adding that ""more suitable"" sites were being brought forward to ""ease pressure on communities"".

But Jacqui Broadhead, director of the Global Exchange on Migration and Diversity at the University of Oxford, said a ""long-term reimagining"" of asylum policies may be required.

She suggested one solution was to invest in more temporary accommodation instead of paying private providers to oversee asylum accommodation sites such as hotels. After initially being used to help the asylum backlog, she said it could aid the housing shortage more generally.

She highlighted the importance of co-ordination between local authorities and the Home Office, adding that increased and faster decision-making on asylum claims can ""put very high levels of pressure"" on housing services that are already ""extremely stretched"".

Some seven to eight million people in the UK take statins

Cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins, used by millions, are far safer than previously thought, a major review has found. 

Leaflets in packs should be changed to reflect this and avoid scaring people off using the life-saving pills, say the authors. 

Statins do not cause the majority of the possible side effects listed, including memory loss, depression, sleep disturbance, weight gain and impotence, says the team funded by the British Heart Foundation. Meanwhile, they can slash a person's risk of heart attacks and strokes. 

The results, in 

The Lancet journal

, come from trials involving more than 120,000 people comparing statins with a dummy drug or placebo. 

Statins are highly effective at lowering ""bad"" LDL cholesterol levels and have been repeatedly proven to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease - a condition that causes some 10 million deaths worldwide and a quarter of all deaths in the UK, say the researchers from Oxford University. 

As with any medicine, there can be side effects, but these are few.

Reports of adverse effects were almost identical in the placebo group that was not on the medication, suggesting statins are not the cause. 

None of the patients in the trials knew if the pill they were taking was real or a pretend one.

In the review, only four side-effects out of 66 listed were found to have any association with taking statins, and only in a very small proportion of patients.

The four were:

liver test changes

minor liver abnormalities

urine changes

tissue swelling

There was no increase in liver disease such as hepatitis or liver failure, suggesting that the liver blood test changes did not lead to more serious liver problems.

Statin therapy can sometimes cause muscle damage, but this is rare. They can also cause a small increase in blood sugar levels which might bring on diabetes sooner in people who are susceptible. Again, this is rare. 

Lead author Prof Christina Reith said worries about statin safety had deterred many people who could benefit from taking them.

""Ongoing confusion and concern about side effects mean many people are not willing to start them or stop them. This is a major issue."" 

That's not to say people do not experience things while on them,"" she added, ""but we now have really good evidence that statins are not the cause of common problems.

""Our study provides reassurance that, for most people, the risk of side effects is greatly outweighed by the benefits.""

Her colleague Prof Sir Rory Collins, who is the review's senior author, said: ""Now that we know that statins do not cause the majority of side effects listed in package leaflets, statin information requires rapid revision to help patients and doctors make better-informed health decisions.""

Prof Bryan Williams, from the British Heart Foundation, suggested many people were missing out on statins due to stories around unproven possible side effects.

""Prescribers have been intoxicated by this negative publicity. 

""We are absolutely delighted to see the outcomes of this study. These findings should provide very powerful reassurance,"" Prof Williams said.

Experts stress statins save lives, but if you have any problem with your medication you should chat with your doctor.

Louvre Museum

The Louvre issued the first photos of the crown since the raid, showing the damage it sustained

The crown of French Empress Eugenie was left crushed after being dropped by fleeing thieves during the raid at the Louvre last October - but is ""nearly intact"" and can be fully restored, the museum has said.

Raiders stole an estimated 88 million euros (£76m, $104m) in jewels, but left the diamond-studded headpiece belonging to the wife of Napoleon III on their escape route.

The museum has issued the first photographs of the crown since the theft, saying it had been left ""badly deformed"" after the thieves tried to remove it through a narrow hole they sawed in its glass display case.

The crown is missing one of eight golden eagles that adorned it but retains its 56 emeralds and all but 10 of its 1,354 diamonds.

Louvre Museum

It added the 19th Century crown would be restored to its original state ""without the need for reconstruction"".

An expert committee led by the museum's president Laurence des Cars had been selected to supervise the restoration.

The heist took place on 19 October and saw the gang use a stolen vehicle-mounted mechanical lift to gain access to the Galerie d'Apollon (Gallery of Apollo) via a balcony close to the River Seine.

Two of the thieves got inside by cutting through the window with power tools. They then threatened the guards, who evacuated the area, and cut through the glass of two display cases housing jewellery that once belonged to French royalty or its imperial rulers.

Prosecutors said the thieves were inside for less than four minutes before making their escape on two scooters waiting outside.

Police have arrested four male suspects who prosecutors allege are the thieves - but the mastermind behind the raid has not been tracked down. 

The seven other items of jewellery taken, including a diamond-studded tiara that belonged to Eugenie and necklaces, ear-rings and brooches remain missing.

Jacob Elordi, Charli XCX and Margot Robbie speak to BBC News at the Wuthering Heights premiere

Ever wondered how an actor from Brisbane, Australia, perfects a Northern accent?

The answer may surprise you.

""I just practise it in the bath, over and over and over and over,"" said Jacob Elordi, who is starring as Heathcliffe in the hotly anticipated new film Wuthering Heights, set on the tempestuous Yorkshire moors.

""I like the meks and the teks, instead of take. I like the M-E-K, T-E-K,"" he said, spelling the words out.

Elordi, 28, is starring opposite fellow Aussie actor Margot Robbie in Emerald Fennell's new take on Emily Brontë’s classic novel.

Before the film has even come out, it has sparked some 

controversy over its casting

 as well as its apparent BDSM-inspired scenes.

But there's also been a huge build-up for the film, and at the premiere in rainy central London on Thursday night, scores of screaming fans turned out for a glimpse of two of the hottest stars on the planet.

Leicester Square had been decked out to resemble the wilds of Yorkshire, and the red carpet was actually charcoal black, to fit the gothic vibe of the film.

Brat singer Charli XCX was also among the stars braving the drizzle.

The 33-year-old, whose real name is Charlotte Emma Aitchison, has written an album for the upcoming film, with tracks including Chains Of Love, Wall Of Sound and House.

When speaking to BBC News, Charli peered out from under a pale, pink veil which formed part of a striking bridal ensemble. ""Sorry, I can barely see you,"" she admitted.

The film features a soundtrack written by Brat singer Charli XCX

But when asked how she'd found the transition from the lime green, Brat summer vibe of her award-winning album to the darker themes of this film, she lit up.

""Honestly, [it was] really, really fun. I always like to work in polar opposites. And so this was, honestly, a dream project to me,"" she said.

""When I first started making music, I was so inspired by so many of the references that Emerald and I were talking about, Shakespeares Sister to The Cure, to obviously Kate Bush,"" she said (singer-songwriter Bush famously wrote her debut single, Wuthering Heights, as a teenager in the 1970s).

""So yeah, this was really heavenly to work on.""

The singer is also starring in the satirical film The Moment, which revisits the cultural phenomenon that followed the release of her 2024 album.

But she indicated that she was very ready to say goodbye to Brat summer. ""Yes. Let's put it in the ground. I'm ready.""

Margot Robbie is a producer on the new film, as well as starring in it

Barbie star Robbie, who plays Cathy, dazzled fans on Thursday turning up in a striking, corseted Gothic gown with a matching choker.

She also wore a replica of Charlotte Brontë's bracelet. She told BBC News the original was believed to have been woven out of the hair of Charlotte's sisters: Emily and Anne.

The actress, who is also a producer on the new film, is well known for method dressing, having dressed as the famous plastic doll for her press appearances back in 2023.

There has been a lot of interest in the relationship between Robbie and Elordi. The pair seem to have closely bonded while filming, and even have matching signet rings - although some have dismissed their closeness as a marketing stunt.

Elordi even confirmed the reports that he'd left flowers in his co-star's dressing room on Valentine's Day, telling the BBC emphatically: ""Yes.""

Jacob Elordi and Margot Robbie are said to have grown close during filming

When asked whether it was the Australian connection that brought them closer, Robbie agreed.

""Yeah, it was certainly nice to work with someone who's from somewhere so close to where I'm from,"" she said.

But she added everyone on set ""really bonded on this job"".

""I think we were all so excited to be executing [Fennell's] vision, and she really gives you the space to feel safe, but really go for it. And everyone really went for it.""

The film is written, directed and produced by Fennell, who won an Oscar for her breakthrough film Promising Young Woman in 2021. Her last feature Saltburn - also starring Elordi - gained viral notoriety for its salacious scenes 

(including 

that

Audience reaction at the test screenings for Wuthering Heights 

was mixed

, with much talk of a shocking opening scene of a public hanging in which the ""condemned man ejaculates mid-execution"".

But first reactions to the film on social media have been overwhelmingly positive, with film writer Anne Thompson 

calling it

 ""a rip-roaring, bodice-ripping crowd-pleaser"" and critic Courtney Howard 

saying it

 ""expertly captures the breathtaking ache and essence of desire"".

When asked about the provocative nature of the film, Robbie said she thought people ""might be a little surprised"" by how emotional it actually is.

""I know there's been a lot of talk about it being provocative, but I think it's emotional more than anything. It's very romantic. It's very epic. It's like large scale filmmaking, very cinematic.""

Cast and crew braved the rain for the UK premiere of Wuthering Heights

Set in the 18th Century, Wuthering Heights is a story of desire, obsession and revenge, following the affair between the wild Catherine Earnshaw and the dashing Heathcliff.

It may be one of the most enduring - and tragic - love stories ever written, but when Robbie and Elordi's casting was announced, many film fans were left unimpressed.

Some pointed out that Catherine is in her teens in the book, unlike Robbie who is 35. Meanwhile Heathcliff is described in the novel, written in 1847, as ""dark-skinned"", although his ancestry is ambiguous.

But Fennell has previously defended the decision to cast Elordi, telling the Hollywood Reporter that it was 

her own take on the story

.

Warner Bros. Pictures

Wuthering Heights is being released in time for Valentine's Day

""The great thing about this movie is that it could be made every year and it would still be so moving and so interesting,"" she added. ""There are so many different takes. I think every year we should have a new one.""

The novel has been adapted for the screen numerous times.

The last film came out in 2011 and was made by director Andrea Arnold, starring Skins actress Kaya Scodelario as Catherine and James Howson as Heathcliff.

Juliette Binoche and Ralph Fiennes appeared in a 1992 version.

On TV in 2009, ITV cast Tom Hardy as Heathcliff and Charlotte Riley as his doomed love interest.

The new film also stars Adolescence’s Owen Cooper as a young Heathcliff, as well as Alison Oliver, Hong Chau, Shazad Latif, Martin Clunes, and Ewan Mitchell in supporting roles.

Wuthering Heights is released in UK cinemas on 13 February.

Pembrokeshire Herald

Police were called to Milford Haven Comprehensive School in Pembrokeshire on Thursday afternoon.

A 15-year-old boy has been arrested on suspicion of attempted murder after a teacher was injured at a school. 

Dyfed-Powys Police said officers were called to Milford Haven Comprehensive School in Pembrokeshire at about 15:20 GMT on Thursday. 

Supt Chris Neve said they were responding to reports of the assault of a teacher by a pupil brandishing a weapon.

""The teacher's injury is not a stab injury. A lockdown was implemented but has now been lifted,"" he said. 

The teacher has since been discharged, police said.

Wales First Minister Eluned Morgan said ""violence of any kind has no place in our schools"". 

""All pupils at the location were safe, and all returned home unharmed,"" said Supt Neve.

He added that police had left the school, and that the 15-year-old boy was in police custody. 

""Parents and guardians will continue to receive any future updates directly through the school app.

""You will see a higher than usual police presence in the area over the coming days – these will be dedicated patrols to provide further reassurance to those living in and attending school in the area,"" he added.

John Harvey, leader of Pembrokeshire council, thanked staff and pupils for ""implementing a swift and effective lockdown"".

He added that the school would be closed on Friday, but that help would be available for those requiring additional support.

After school events were cancelled on Thursday.

Pembrokeshire Herald

There was a police presence outside the school on Thursday afternoon

A Welsh Ambulance Service spokesperson said they were called to the scene on Thursday afternoon and one patient was transported to hospital.

Morgan, who visited the school last week, said her thoughts were with the injured teacher, their family and the entire school community, adding her government would support all those affected.

Mid and South Pembrokeshire MP Henry Tufnell said he was ""very grateful to the school staff and our emergency services for their swift response in ensuring the safety of pupils and colleagues"".

He described the local area as a ""really close community"".

Following the incident, Matt Wrack, the general secretary of the NASUWT teachers' union, said schools ""should be places of safety and learning - not fear and violence"". 

""We will be standing by to offer all the support we can,"" he said.

Three African countries have agreed to take back foreign offenders and illegal migrants after the UK Home Secretary threatened them with visa penalties.

A month after the threat from Shabana Mahmood, Namibia and Angola agreed to cooperate on returns. The Home Secretary has now also secured cooperation from the DRC.

""My message is clear, if foreign governments refuse to accept the return of their citizens, then they will face consequences,"" she said following the agreement.

The UK government had previously warned it would stop granting visas to people from Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) if their governments did not improve co-operation on removals.

The Home Office had said that returns from the DRC, Angola and Namibia were being frustrated - with paperwork not being processed or people being required to sign their own documents - giving them an effective veto. 

It had warned that the three countries faced penalties for their ""unacceptably poor and obstructive returns processes"".

While setting out changes to the UK's asylum system in November, Mahmood warned visa penalties would be applied to countries that failed to co-operate with returns policies. 

Penalties included an ""emergency brake"" on visas for countries with high asylum claims until they take back citizens in the UK illegally.

Following the agreement with the three countries, Mahmood said: ""Illegal migrants and dangerous criminals will now be removed and deported back to Angola, Namibia and the Democratic Republic of Congo.""

""I will do what it takes to secure our order and control to our borders,""

 

she added.

The government says over 3,000 people from these three countries could be eligible to be removed or deported due to the cooperation.

The Home Secretary has indicated that ​countries which refuse to work with the UK on returns cannot expect a normal visa relationship, with further threats expected for lack of cooperation.

It is understood that India, Pakistan, Nigeria, Bangladesh, Somalia and Gabon are all resistant to returns deals and it is possible that the government could look at sanctions for those countries.

5 February 2026

The World Anti-Doping Agency could investigate if evidence emerges that male ski jumpers are injecting their penises in a bid to improve sporting performance.

In January, German newspaper 

Bild

, 

external

 reported that jumpers were injecting their penises with hyaluronic acid before being measured for their suits.

Hyaluronic acid, which is not banned in sport, can be used to increase penis circumference by 

one or two centimetres

.

This would increase the surface area of their suits during competition, which, according to FIS, the international ski and snowboard federation, could increase their flight in the air.

""Every extra centimetre on a suit counts. If your suit has a 5% bigger surface area, you fly further,"" said FIS ski jumping men's race director Sandro Pertile.

Asked about the claims in Bild at a press conference at the Milan-Cortina Winter Olympics, Wada director general Olivier Niggli said: ""I am not aware of the details of ski jumping, and how that could improve performance. 

""If anything was to come to the surface, we would look at it and see if it is doping related. We don't address other [non-doping] means of enhancing performance.""

Clearly entertained by the question, Wada's Polish president Witold Banka joked: ""Ski jumping is very popular in Poland so I promise you I'm going to look at it.""

FIS communications director Bruno Sassi told BBC Sport: ""There has never been any indication, let alone evidence, that any competitor has ever made use of a hyaluronic acid injection to attempt to gain a competitive advantage.""

Before the start of each season, ski jumpers are measured using 3D body scanners, in which they must wear only ""elastic, body-tight underwear"". 

Rules state their suits must have a tolerance of only 2-4cm, and as part of the measuring process, their crotch height is also measured.

The crotch height of their suit must conform to the athlete's crotch height, with the addition of 3cm for men.

Hyularonic acid injected into the penis can last up to 18 months.

There have been previous attempts to improve performance through manipulations of the suits.

In August, Norwegian Olympic medallists Marius Lindvik and Johann Andre Forfang accepted three-month suspensions for their part in the tampering of suits during the men's large hill event at the World Ski Championships in Trondheim, Norway, in March.

While it later transpired the athletes themselves were not aware of the tampering, FIS said their team had ""tried to cheat the system"" by putting reinforced thread in their jumpsuits.

Both athletes are set to compete at these Winter Olympics, which officially start on Friday.

The men's ski jumping competition begins on Monday.

Lord Mandelson was appointed as the UK's ambassador in Washington in December 2024

Documents relating to Lord Mandelson's appointment as the UK's ambassador to the US are due to be released, following pressure from MPs.

Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has acknowledged the vetting process included discussion of Lord Mandelson's continued relationship with Jeffrey Epstein after he was convicted.

However, he has accused Lord Mandelson of lying throughout the process and misrepresenting the extent of their relationship.

The BBC understands Mandelson's view is that he answered questions about his relationship with Epstein in the vetting process accurately.

It was essentially a two-stage process: an initial due diligence check prior to his appointment, followed by security vetting. So how did it work? 

Due diligence

The due diligence check was carried out by a team at the Cabinet Office on behalf of Downing Street, as the prime minister was responsible for the appointment.

The point of this check is to identify reputational risks or potential conflicts of interests that may need to be considered during the hiring process. 

Sir Chris Wormald, the UK's top civil servant, has previously 

confirmed to MPs

 that this was largely based on public information, such as media reports.

At the time, it was public knowledge that the peer had maintained his relationship with Epstein after his conviction for soliciting sex from a minor in 2008.

In 2023, the Financial Times reported emails suggesting he stayed at Epstein's Manhattan mansion in 2009, while the financier was in jail.

The only non-public information that featured, Sir Chris added, were records of a meeting Lord Mandelson facilitated between Epstein and Sir Tony Blair that have since been disclosed by the National Archives.

This appears to be a reference to a 

meeting in Downing Street

 in 2002, six years before Epstein's conviction.

Lord Mandelson's file included information about his previous roles inside and outside government, and his ""professional and financial relationships"".

His prior relationship with Epstein was listed as a reputational risk, Sir Chris added, alongside his previous two resignations as a minister during the last Labour government. 

Follow-up questions

After reviewing the file, No 10 sources said Sir Keir asked Lord Mandelson to address three specific questions, which were sent to him via email by the prime minister's chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney.

These questions were: why has he continued contact with Epstein after he was convicted? Why was he reported to have stayed in one of Epstein's homes while the financier was in prison? And was he associated with a charity founded by Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell that the financier had backed?

At the time, his answers were considered sufficient for him to be appointed to the role, meaning he then underwent security vetting. No 10 will no doubt face pressure to release them as part of the disclosure process 

approved by MPs

.

Security vetting

In addition to providing information about his private interests, Lord Mandelson would have undergone security vetting before taking up the role.

The Foreign Office, which is responsible for Britain's overseas embassies, says all ambassadors are 

required to go through

 developed vetting (DV), the most intrusive process required to access the most secret government information.

Security vetting is carried out by United Kingdom Security Vetting (UKSV), a specialist agency within the Cabinet Office.

The process is designed to make sure those being vetted are unlikely to abuse their access to secret material, or be subject to blackmail or bribery.

According to 

government guidance

, those undergoing DV are required to fill out various questionnaires including information about their personal finances, internet use, medical conditions, and email addresses they hold.

Several checks are carried out, including on candidates' credit history and to check if they have any criminal records. 

Those being vetted also have to undertake an interview with a specially trained vetting officer, which can cover areas including candidates' health, friendships, family and sexual history. 

The UKSV decides whether or not to award security clearance, and can attach mitigations, such as being prevented from seeing certain information.

The results of this vetting are kept within a tight circle and only the vetting agency and the security team can see the contents. Ministers, including the prime minister, never see the details.

Ultimately, Lord Mandelson was announced as the UK's ambassador to the US in December 2024.

However, after less than a year in the role, he was sacked last September following the emergence of new emails revealing supportive messages he sent to Epstein after he pleaded guilty to sex offences.

The government said the depth of their relationship was not known when he was appointed.

However, the PM is now facing questions over whether the information in the public domain was enough to raise alarm bells.

Thorbjørn Jagland's lawyer promised his client's full co-operation with the investigation

Police in Norway have opened a corruption investigation into the country's former Prime Minister Thorbjørn Jagland over his alleged links to the late convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. 

A special Norwegian police unit which is analysing newly released Epstein files in the US said the 75-year-old was suspected of ""aggravated corruption"". 

Police said they had already asked the country's foreign ministry to lift his immunity, which he enjoys because of his past role as a senior foreign diplomat. 

Jagland is also a former head of the Norwegian Nobel Committee and spent 10 years as secretary general of the Council of Europe. 

His lawyer said they would fully co-operate with the investigation.

Pål K. Lønseth, head of Økokrim - the economic crime unit investigating Jagland - said: ""We consider there are reasonable grounds for investigation, given that he held the positions of chair of the Nobel Committee and Secretary General of the Council of Europe during the period covered by the released documents.

""Among other things, Økokrim will investigate whether gifts, travel and loans were received in connection with his position.""

The police added that further details would be given ""at a later stage"".

Norwegian Foreign Minister Espen Barth Eide said it was ""important that the facts of this case are brought to light"".

He added that Oslo would ask the Council of Europe for Jagland's immunity to be revoked.

Jagland's lawyer Anders Brosveet welcomed the opening of the investigation.

""Based on what we have found so far, we are confident of the outcome,"" he told Reuters news agency. 

Separately, Brosveet told Norway's VG news site that he and his client would submit ""the key findings and documentation we have to Økokrim as soon as practically possible"".

Jagland was Norway's prime minister in 1996-97, and the secretary general of the Council of Europe in 2009-19.

He also chaired the Norwegian Nobel Committee in 2009-15.

Unredacted images and videos showing nudity released in the Epstein files have been online for days despite US officials being warned about failures in redaction, which lawyers say has caused victims ""irreparable"" harm.

The files seen by BBC Verify are among thousands of documents lawyers say they have discovered that contain identifying information about dozens of Epstein's victims.

Victims groups first spoke out about the issue at the weekend when the New York Times reported nearly 40 separate images had been published as part of the Epstein files on Friday.

On Tuesday, a New York judge said the Department of Justice (DoJ) had agreed to quickly fix the issue after victims called for the website to be shut down until names and images could be properly redacted.

The DoJ 

removed thousands of documents from its website

, stating that the files had been uploaded due to ""technical or human error"". The department said it was continuing to examine new requests, as well as checking whether there were any other documents that might need further redaction.

BBC Verify found independently that a number of images of identifiable people were still online on Wednesday, despite the US government stating it was tackling the issue of incomplete redactions the previous day. We have approached the DoJ for comment and supplied the names of unredacted files.

""The damage done is irreparable,""  Brad Edwards, a lawyer representing the victims, said in a statement.

""I'm heartbroken for the girls whose information was released,"" Ashley Rubright, a survivor of Epstein's abuse, told the BBC. ""That's such a huge violation of one of the most horrible moments of their lives.""

Four of the images identified by BBC Verify showed partially clothed young females with their faces and bodies unredacted.

They were found during a general search of the millions of files released for evidence of Epstein's interactions with public figures.

Photos of other people appear to have been redacted in some documents but left unredacted elsewhere. One document contained two versions of the same picture, one showing the face covered with a black square and another that showed the face in full.

Another video also identified someone who was seen lifting up her shirt and showing her breast to the camera.

Who is in the Epstein files?

Department of Justice (DoJ) officials were tasked with redacting all sexually explicit photos or any information which could identify victims before the latest tranche of Epstein files was due to be published over the Christmas period.

Ahead of the deadline set by Congress, deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche said the files would not be published on time, citing the extra work needed to guard victims' identities. ""We are looking at every single piece of paper that we are going to produce making sure every victim - their name, their identity, their story, to the extent that it needs to be protected - is completely protected,"" he said at the time.

BBC Verify has separately found the identities of several people have been revealed in medical information and legal statements published in the files.

One name was shown in full in two videos showing foetal ultrasound scans. The time, date and what appears to be the location of the scans, as well as the gestational age of the foetus, were also clearly visible.

Another document contained a recording of Epstein being questioned in which a lawyer mentioned the name of at least one victim.

Lawyers for Epstein's victims have heavily criticised the DoJ for its failure to adequately protect hundreds of women identified in the files.

""We are getting constant calls from victims because their names – despite them never coming forward, being completely unknown to the public – have all just been released for public consumption,"" Brad Edwards, one of the attorneys, said on Sunday.

""It's literally thousands of mistakes.""

Thousands of retirement flats stand empty in England and Wales 

Families have told the BBC they are being left to pay thousands of pounds a year in fees for empty retirement properties inherited from loved ones.

They say retirement homes, which only people over a certain age are allowed to buy, can be hard to sell, even at hugely discounted prices.

One person told the BBC they had dropped the asking price of their late mother's flat by £200,000 and still had no offers. As such properties fail to sell, families are left to pay ongoing service charges.

Another man told the BBC the annual cost of his late mother's flat was more than £11,000 a year once ground rent, council tax and services charges were combined.

'It's become a millstone'

One expert estimated there could be 10,000 long-term, empty properties in privately owned retirement blocks across England and Wales.

Gordon Taylor's mother, Joan, moved into her flat in Burgess Hill in 2015, when she paid £225,000 for the 125-year lease.

It was in an ""age restricted"" block of flats for over-70s, built and run by one of the biggest developers in the country, McCarthy Stone.

It was part of their Retirement Living Plus portfolio, which includes on-site staff, an hour a week of home help and an in-house restaurant.

Taylor, 71, remembers that ""as soon as the salesperson took her up to the flat, that was it, she was sold - she absolutely loved it"".

Gordon Taylor faces £11,279 annual charges on his late mother's flat

Joan died in June 2024, aged 96, and left her flat to her family.

However, it has been on the market and empty ever since and is now for sale for £170,000 - £55,000 less than it was bought for.

The terms of the lease mean it can only be bought by someone over the age of 70 and Taylor says there have been no serious offers.

In the meantime, the annual service charge of £9,700, ground rent of £435 and council tax of £1,044 mount up as unpaid debt.

""She probably thought she was leaving something to her offspring, only to find that it's become a millstone,"" says Taylor.

He says the market for the flats has collapsed, in part because future buyers are put off by the scale of the standing charges.

Joan died in June 2024, aged 96, and left her flat to her son

At least 18 other flats in the block of 56 are also empty and on the market, with the same lease restriction.

Taylor points out that four miles away, in Haywards Heath, McCarthy Stone is building a new development for the over 60s, despite Corbett Court being 30% empty.

""It's a massive issue, it's a national issue; the system in this sector is obviously broken,"" he says.

McCarthy Stone told the BBC that, in a survey, 86% of residents at Corbett Court said they were satisfied with the development.

The company says it offers the option to defer the service charge and does all it can to help families ""achieve a quick sale at a good price"".

It recognises that flats may decrease in value but insists its ""in-house resales team has a strong track record of success"".

'Can't give them away' 

The BBC has found that Taylor's situation is repeated across England - including with other providers - with people unable to sell their dead relative's property and struggling to pay standing charges.

We spoke to families in Berkshire, Hampshire, Buckinghamshire, Norfolk, West Sussex, Shropshire, London, Surrey, Leicestershire and Derbyshire.

One property we found had been vacant for more than nine years. In another case, family members face £60,000 in charges accrued since the property became vacant in 2019.

A relative told us it was ""like a noose around our necks"", and another expressed frustration that ""you can't give them away"".

Another beneficiary reported paying service charges of £750 per month on a flat that has been empty for four years, describing it as a ""never-ending nightmare"", adding: ""It is infuriating and heartbreaking in equal measure.""

The Retirement Housing Group (RHG), which represents the industry, disputes the figures and claims that 95% of these kinds of properties are occupied.

It maintains the level of long-term empty properties in the sector is ""not disproportionately high"".

Corbett Court in Burgess Hill is 30% empty 

Critics believe problems in the sector are caused by a combination of issues. They cite high service charges and a small, age-restricted pool of potential older buyers.

Restrictive leases, a fear of communal living post Covid, and an oversupply of similar accommodation are all possible factors.

Some housing experts believe the scale of the problem has been underestimated.

Adam Cliff is secretary of the Empty Homes Network, which supports housing officers in local authorities to bring properties back into use.

""A significant amount of homes are ready to be lived in, but are restricted in many cases by the contracts that are holding these people effectively to ransom,"" Cliff says.

""People are even getting to the stage of saying, 'How do we give these properties away?' It's heartbreaking to see and hear some of the stories of those not able to sell properties for two, three, four, sometimes five years or more.""

Parish council objects to retirement home plans

The RHG disputes this figure and say this kind of accommodation provides ""independence, support and companionship in later life"".

The organisation says the sector is not immune to a downturn in the general housing market and insists there are measures in place to ""support people during the resales process"".

But campaigners suggest several solutions to the problem, including the reduction or delay of service charges until a sale has gone through.

They say leases could be re-examined with age restrictions being potentially lifted and planning applications for new retirement developments should be considered in light of existing vacancies.

Taylor says his mother would be ""pretty disgusted"" and would be writing letters to the authorities.

He says: ""I am going to keep fighting, I'm not going to stop.""

Hammy McMillan, Bobby Lammie and Grant Hardie, all from Stranraer, are part of Team Mouat - the world champions

It was the pioneering vision of a Stranraer businessman in 1970 that would go on to produce some of Scotland's most successful curlers on the world stage. 

Hamilton ""Hammy"" McMillan and his wife Janet, purchased the North West Castle hotel in 1961, and quickly extended the accommodation from 12 bedrooms to 30. 

But it was a savvy business move and a niche addition six years later that saw the creation of the world's first hotel featuring an in-built ice-rink. 

Since opening 56 years ago, Stranraer's ice-rink has made an indelible mark in the world of curling by churning out multiple European, World and Olympic champions. 

Hammy's son - also called Hammy - won five European championships, while

 Vicky Wright brought home the Olympic gold from Beijing in 2022. 

Now, two of Hammy's grandsons have their sights set on Olympic glory at the winter Milano Cortina games.

Hammy McMillan Jr and his cousin Grant Hardie will join fellow Stranraer local Bobby Lammie as part of Team GB, led by skip Bruce Mouat.

Hammy McMillan, Grant Hardie and Bobby Lammie learned to curl in their hometown

Gail Munro, the daughter of Hammy Sr, is the youngest of five children. 

She was just four years old when the ice-rink was built and it has played an integral part in her life - she's been the manager for almost 20 years.  

She said it was local curlers who first sparked the idea for a rink, as they were tired of travelling 50 miles to Ayr or, even further, to Glasgow to enjoy their sport. 

Stranraer curling rink manager Gail Munro was four years old when her father built the ice rink

As a proud businessman, Hammy was also fed up of seeing the curlers leaving his bar to spend money elsewhere during their competitions. 

''They would say to my dad, 'Hammy, we wouldn't need to go away if you would just build us an ice-rink'. 

''Next thing, my dad had plans submitted and six months later we had an ice rink. Here we are, 56 years later and producing world champions.""

McMillan family

Janet and Hammy McMillan bought the hotel in 1961 shortly after they married

From the first foundations being laid in 1819, it seemed that the hotel was destined to become synonymous with ice. 

It was built by the Arctic explorer Rear Admiral Sir John Ross, whose nephew James Clark Ross would later discover the magnetic North Pole. 

But it was 160 years later that the hotel would be put well and truly on the map - this time for curling accolades. 

Success at the 1979 world junior championships was the beginning of Stranraer's long record of producing some of the best curlers in the game.

''Dad only began curling at the age of 40, yet managed to go on and win the senior Scottish championships,"" said Gail. 

""Two different teams won world junior championships in 1980 and 1981, so there were eight local curlers at the top of the tree back in the early 80s.

''In 1999 my brother- also called Hammy - won the elusive world championships and the success just seemed to snowball.""

McMillan family

Hammy McMillan began curling aged 40 and went on to be crowned Senior Scottish Champion

Four years ago Team Mouat - featuring Stranraer's McMillan Jr, Hardie and Lammie - just missed out on the gold medal in Beijing, but they are determined to go one better this time round. 

The team is a formidable force, having now clocked up a record breaking 12 grand slams, four European championships and two world championships. They are currently ranked number one in the world.

''We're super excited and the aim is to get the gold,"" Hammy Jr told BBC Scotland News. 

""It was amazing what mine and Grant's grandfather did, to have the initiative to build a four-sheet ice rink for the community in Stranraer. 

""It's been amazing, and the community that's down there is just fantastic.""

'The place is buzzing'

The ice-rink has never been used for skating - it is unapologetically committed to serving curlers only. 

However, keeping the hotel a success has not been without its challenges. When the Irish sea ferry terminals in Stranraer were closed in 2011- to be moved six miles along the coast to Cairnryan - visitor numbers in the town dwindled. 

But the owners have capitalised on its unique facilities to entice visitors from all corners of the world.

''For 50 years we have offered weekend competition packages, where you enter a rink and you get thrown into a competition,"" said Gail.

""You arrive on a Friday night and you have a full board package, your curling is included and we entertain you with a dance on the Saturday night as well. 

''We have anything from 12 to 24 teams taking part almost every weekend throughout our season for 24 weekends, the place is just thriving and buzzing.""

The North West Castle Hotel was bought by Hammy McMillan in 1961 and renovated and extended, including the addition of the ice-rink in 1970

Stranraer is one of three towns in south-west Scotland that consistently produce a steady stream of elite curlers. 

There are rinks in Dumfries and Lockerbie which are able to boast an impressive list of past and present champions in both the men's and women's games. 

So why is this region of fewer than 150,000 people responsible for producing 50% of this year's Team GB Olympic curlers? 

Munro believes it is down to accessibility and inspiring the youngsters.

''People do look up to the curlers,"" she said. ""They are down there on the ice playing club curling as if it's normal, then they go away and the next weekend they're playing at European and World level.'

''One of the professional curlers came back to play a club game last month and one of the young 13-year-old boys was starstruck. 

""Euan Kyle gave him his brush - well that boy couldn't sleep that night, he had to take his brush to bed, it really was lovely.""

She added: ""They're an inspiration to the next generation coming through.''

Grant Hardie, Hammy McMillan and Bobby Lammie are part of Team Mouat

After more than 50 years, the McMillan family sold the hotel to new owners in 2023, and Munro says they fully support curling in Stranraer. 

The hotel is now gearing up for the beginning of the 2026 games, with the hotel set to host ""watch parties"" if any of the teams make it to the medal matches. 

Grant Hardie said he was grateful for his grandfather's achievements.

""Unfortunately my grandfather is no longer with us,"" he said. 

""But the amount of curlers that would go away and have success on the world stage and come back and thank him every time, and you know we're the same. 

""Without him building the ice rink, our parents would never have played it and we would never have got involved. 

''I'm sure him and my granny were very proud to see us doing well on the world stage. It'll be nice to have our granny out there in Cortina supporting us.''

Why all Olympics curling stones come from this uninhabited Scottish island

Grant's mum, Fiona Hardie, will be joining the team in Italy, alongside Hammy and Bobby's parents. 

She said she has no doubt that her dad's legacy will be the mark he has left on curling. 

''My dad always encouraged young curlers and he was so proud of his grandsons and granddaughter,"" she said.

""My mum and dad would go everywhere to watch them and mum is coming out to Cortina with us. Dad would be so proud.""

""PM battles for survival"" headlines Metro over Sir Keir Starmer's appointment of Lord Mandelson as ambassador to the US. At the time of the appointment, it was public knowledge that Mandelson had maintained a friendship with the paedophile Jeffrey Epstein after his conviction for soliciting sex from a minor. Sir Keir has told critics ""you're helping Reform"" by discussing the matter, according to Metro. The BBC understands Lord Mandelson's view is that he answered questions about his relationship with Epstein in the vetting process accurately. Lord Mandelson has not responded to requests for comment, but the BBC understands his position is that he has not acted in any way criminally and that he was not motivated by financial gain. 

The PM's apology for ""believing Mandelson's lies"" tops the Independent. The paper reports that pressure from Labour MPs is now building ""to sack key aide Morgan McSweeney"".

""Labour 'women in grey suits' may be sent to No 10 to tell PM to resign"", writes the i Paper, a reference to the so-called ""men in grey suits"" who told Margaret Thatcher to resign in 1990. MPs believe the PM is now ""toast"", but Health Secretary Wes Streeting and former Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner ""won't challenge the Prime Minister yet"", according to the paper.

The Times leads with the PM being labelled ""gullible and weak"" by former Labour deputy leader Harriet Harman. The paper says Sir Keir's apology to Epstein's victims for Mandelson's appointment comes as ""Labour dismay grows"".

The Daily Star says Sir Keir is ""in firing line"" over the fallout from the Epstein files. It headlines on ""the spy who failed me"" adding that the PM ""blamed Britain's spies"" for the appointment of Lord Mandelson to the role of ambassador to the US.

The Guardian writes that Starmer is ""in appeal to Labour MPs as pressure grows for No 10 reset"". The paper also reports a private jet owned by ""Trump friend"" and ""Florida property tycoon"" Gil Dezer was used for Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) deportation flights. 

""Starmer apologises to Epstein victims as crisis over Mandelson ties deepens"" headlines the Financial Times, with one minister saying that the PM could see an ""unedifying end"". The paper also splashes on more details from the Epstein files, saying Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor ""touted felon's business during Queen's visit to UAE"".

Former Deputy Labour leader Angela Rayner has told friends she is ""ready to go"" on a leadership campaign, according to the Daily Mail. ""As Starmer fights for his political life"", she is ""primed to strike"", it adds.

The Daily Telegraph reports that an unresolved investigation into Angela Rayner's taxes could thwart any potential bid for the party leadership. Australian actress Margot Robbie is splashed on the front page as the film adaptation of ""Wuthering Heights"" premieres in London - ""it's me, Cathy"", the Telegraph captions the shot.

Former Manchester United captain Wayne Rooney's son has been ""offered Man U deal"" leads the Sun. The ""teen is target"" as the paper headlines ""on me red, son"". 

""Daily statins safe for millions more to take"" writes the Daily Express. A major review has found that the ""cholesterol-busting drugs are not responsible for side effects"", it reports.

Gut health has become one of social media's favourite buzzwords. 

From drinking chia seed water first thing in the morning to adding sea moss gel to smoothies and sipping bone broth to ""heal"" your gut, these products are credited with everything from better moods to more energy. 

But behind the viral foods, scientists say the reality is more complicated - especially as it's a growing field with new evidence emerging almost every day. 

While the gut microbiome does play a crucial role in our wellbeing, evidence for many of these fixes is thin and for most healthy people, obsessing over gut ""healing"" may be unnecessary.

What is the gut microbiome?

BBC science broadcaster Caroline Steel describes the gut as the entire digestive tract, from mouth to anus. 

Inside it lives the gut microbiome - trillions of bacteria, viruses and fungi that play a crucial role in how the body functions and ""impacts your mental and physical health"".

Steel says our ""gut microbiome is more unique than our fingerprint"" and a healthy microbiome is linked to better energy extraction from food, blood sugar regulation and immune defence. 

Research also suggests associations between gut health and mental wellbeing

, including lower anxiety and improved mood.

Do viral foods live up to the hype?

Microbiologist Alan Walker and gut health scientist Dr Megan Rossi say many trending foods contain a ""small seed of truth"" but are often oversold as miracle products.

Chia seed water: 

Chia seeds are rich in fibre, ""which can feed beneficial gut bacteria and help with bowel regularity"" according to Rossi. Walker explains that no single fibre source is enough on its own as different microbes feed on different fibres, so diversity matters more than any one ingredient. ""There's no harm in drinking chia seed water,"" he says, but it has little benefit on its own. 

Olive oil shots: 

Olive oil is widely considered to have anti-inflammatory benefits, is heart-healthy and may help ease constipation, Walker explains. However, there is little evidence that taking it as a concentrated ""shot"" specifically boosts the microbiome. ""There's no meaningful difference between drinking it straight and adding it to your food,"" Walker says.

Sea moss gel: 

Sea moss gel, a type of seaweed, has become a hyped product as it provides fibre and certain vitamins and minerals. Yet Rossi says ""there's very little scientific evidence supporting its use for improving the gut microbiome or digestive function"". She particularly cautions against high doses, especially in those with inflammatory bowel disease. Walker says the potential downside to sea moss gel is that seaweeds are a source of heavy metals and iodine and excessive intake may cause health problems.

Getty Images

Bone broth: 

Bone broth is nutrient-dense and can be a comforting food but Walker explains most of its nutrients are absorbed in the small intestine, while the majority of gut microbes live in the large intestine. That means little reaches the microbes themselves. ""There's no strong evidence it has systematic beneficial effects on the gut microbiome,"" he adds. Rossi agrees and adds that she's seen ""the negative effect it can have on cholesterol levels if the saturated fat isn't skimmed off the top of it"". 

Kombucha

: Kombucha is a fermented tea and Rossi says she's a ""big fan"" of traditional kombucha because it contains natural acids and antioxidant plant compounds created during fermentation, which are linked to health benefits. However, just like extra virgin olive oil, not all kombucha is created equal. ""Look for floaters, which are a sign of a living kombucha culture working its magic; check for added vinegar – the real deal doesn't need this added as the microbes do it themselves; and ditch the sugar-free varieties with added sweeteners, including stevia,"" she says.

Steel says signs that something may be wrong with your gut can include persistent constipation, diarrhoea, excessive gas or ongoing abdominal pain. 

In these cases, she explains it's important people should seek medical advice rather than turning to extreme elimination diets.

""If you've got a problem with your gut then doing something like cutting out bread isn't going to heal it."" 

She stresses that most people do not need dramatic dietary interventions and ""most of us don't need to heal our gut as if your gut is healthy, none of these things are going to make a difference"". 

Rather than chasing trends, she says there are some easy things people can do to keep their gut happy like ""eating more plants, increasing fibre and cutting back on ultra-processed foods"".

Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson is trying to build a consensus around the SEND reforms

School funding for special educational needs (SEND) should be increased and protected to meet the rise in demand for support, a group of MPs has said, as ministers consider major reforms.

The cross-party group of mostly Labour MPs called on the government to ""align funding to need"" and give schools ""inflation-proofed"" budgets in its plan to overhaul SEND provision in England.

The proposals are challenging for the government, which faces significant pressures from the rising costs of a SEND system, widely considered to be in crisis.

The Department for Education (DfE) said it was investing more in schools as it seeks to improve outcomes for children with special educational needs.

While the department said school funding is increasing by £1.7bn in 2026-27, budgets appear to be tight once rising SEND costs are taken into account.

The government has decided to pay SEND costs currently covered by councils from 2028, a move that is forecast to create a £6bn pressure.

In 

recent analysis

, the Institute for Fiscal Studies said the government had three options for addressing this pressure: increase education funding, reforms to slow the growth of SEND spending, or cuts.

There is a risk of a backlash against reforms among parents and Labour MPs who are worried SEND support could be limited in some way.

Labour MP Neil Duncan-Jordan, who rebelled against the government's welfare reforms last year, said any changes to SEND provision had to be ""driven by making the system better, not by saving money"".

""We need buy-in from parents for this to work,"" the MP for Poole said.

""The last thing any government needs is an army of parents who are against them because they think they're making their lives worse.""

Local authorities have a legal duty to meet the needs of eligible pupils but are struggling to afford the mounting costs of this as demand grows. More than 1.7 million children in England have special educational needs and the number has risen considerably in recent years.

Public spending on children with high needs has increased from £7.5bn in 2016 to £12bn in 2025, a real-terms rise of 66%.

A government policy paper that is expected to propose changes to SEND provision is due to be published in February, after being delayed.

The Department for Education launched a survey last year and the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on SEND submitted proposals, which have been seen by the BBC.

Ministers 'in listening mode'

In the submission, the group said: ""Inflation has eroded the real value of core funding in schools and special places; restoring it and protecting early help budgets will underpin timely support.""

The MPs also said national SEND policy ""should align expectations and funding with the level of need settings are now asked to meet"".

The APPG also called for more investment in early years and a national SEND workforce plan.

Anything perceived as cuts would alarm many involved in the APPG, a group that is keen to influence Education Secretary Bridget Phillipson as her department prepares the reforms.

In recent months, ministers have been meeting Labour MPs from the group to get their input and build support for the reforms, should they be voted on in Parliament.

Ministers have faced calls not to scrap education, health and care plans (EHCPs), which are legal documents guaranteeing bespoke support for pupils assessed as having high needs.

One MP said ministers are ""in listening mode"".

Labour MP Jen Craft said money is not being spent well in the SEND system

Labour MP Jen Craft, a vice-chair of the APPG who is the mother of a disabled daughter with an EHCP, recently met Phillipson to discuss SEND issues.

The MP for Thurrock said improving early intervention and making mainstream schools more inclusive could lead to a reduction in high-needs support and save money.

""The system is not necessarily focused on the needs of the children it is supposed to be there to help,"" Craft said. ""There's an enormous amount of money in the system but it's not being spent well.""

She has organised events to gather the views of pupils, parents and teachers on SEND provision in her Thurrock constituency.

In a report, she wrote: ""The government should look closely at its plans for SEND funding, particularly the discrepancies between local authorities, the potential to ringfence budgets, and investment in early years to prevent children's needs escalating.""

All parties in Westminster agree the SEND system in England needs reforming.

The Conservatives and the Green Party have not set out clear policies.

The Liberal Democrats have outlined five fundamental principles that should underpin the coming reform, including a ""fair funding system"" that incentivises schools to accept SEND pupils.

Reform UK is developing its own SEND policy and is expected to set out some of its ideas early this year.

""SEND needs reform not more money,"" Reform MP Richard Tice said. ""It has had billions more in recent years and outcomes have not improved at all.""

A DfE spokesperson said the government was spending £200m on giving all teachers SEND training and at least £3bn on creating 50,000 new specialist places.

The spokesperson said the SEND reforms ""will be driven by our mission to improve outcomes for all children"".

The department, the spokesperson added, was ""laying the groundwork for an inclusive education system where children are supported at the earliest stage and can thrive in a school that meets their needs, close to home"".

Ruthless France inflicted more pain on Ireland as the Six Nations holders opened their title defence with a bonus-point victory at a buoyant Stade de France. 

Having crushed Ireland's title hopes in emphatic fashion in Dublin last year, Les Bleus - with returning captain Antoine Dupont pulling the strings - roared into a 22-0 half-time lead following a one-sided first half that was not without controversy. 

France's first try was scored by the electric Louis Bielle-Biarrey, but only after what appeared to be a forward pass in the build-up. 

Matthieu Jalibert and Charles Ollivon also crossed in the first half, before 2025 top try-scorer Bielle-Biarrey's stylish second secured France's bonus point seven minutes after the interval. 

At that point, France looked poised to surpass the 42 points they managed in Dublin last year, but Ireland refused to give in and narrowed the deficit with tries from replacement forwards Nick Timoney and Michael Milne.

The hosts, however, had the final word when Theo Attissogbe capped a thoroughly satisfying evening for the tournament favourites.

The Irish leave the French capital bruised and empty-handed and must regroup in time to face Italy in Dublin on 14 February, with France travelling to Wales the following day.

There's a 'hell of a lot of work to do' - Farrell reaction to Ireland loss

With an extensive injury list, this was always going to be a big ask for Ireland.

Severely depleted at both prop positions and without potential gamebreakers like Hugo Keenan and Mack Hansen, Farrell's hand was weakened before he brought his squad back to the scene of their agonising World Cup quarter-final loss to New Zealand in 2023.

But even if Ireland feel hard done by calls that did not go their way, there is no question they were simply outplayed at times by a scintillating French outfit driven on by a delighted Parisian crowd.

While Ollivon's knock-on denied France a second-minute try, Bordeaux speedster Bielle-Biarrey beat Jamison Gibson-Park, rode Sam Prendergast's tap tackle and ghosted past Jacob Stockdale to finish a move that featured a suspected forward pass from Nicolas Depoortere to Yoram Moefana.

The high-intensity, unstructured nature of the game suited France's fleet-footed backline, but it was an Irish defensive lapse that led to the home side's second try.

After Tommy O'Brien was forced to dot the ball down in the Irish in-goal area and concede a scrum, Dupont - making his Test return after suffering a serious knee injury against Ireland 11 months ago - popped the ball to Jalibert for the fly-half to mark his first international appearance since last year's Six Nations with a well-taken try.

With Ireland already on the ropes, Ollivon surged past Caelan Doris and slid across the whitewash to give the hosts a commanding halfway lead.

It was also the first time Ireland were held to zero points in a first half since 2020.

Ireland fightback in vain 

When Bielle-Biarrey scampered clear for his second - after a Dupont chip and outrageous volley with the outside of his left boot from Thomas Ramos - and France's fourth try, Ireland looked on course to be on the end of one of their heaviest defeats.

But a gutsy second-half display - that echoed November's chaotic defeat by South Africa - allowed them to at least get a few scores on the board, with Timoney finishing after a line-break from his Ulster team-mate Stuart McCloskey. 

Then replacement tight-head prop Milne marked his Six Nations debut when he burrowed over after another McCloskey surge.

A third Irish try would have stirred French nerves but, while Farrell's side applied pressure, France's defence stood firm, allowing their backs to finish with a flourish as Attissogbe crossed in the corner to complete a miserable Stade de France return for Ireland.

Without established Test veterans Uini Atonio, Gregory Alldritt, Damian Penaud and Gael Fickou, this was a glimpse into France's destructive potential. 

For Ireland, however, they face into a difficult week following their autumn losses to New Zealand and South Africa with another humbling reverse against a fellow member of the world's top five.

Watch: Why winning isn't enough for parties in Thailand's election

Suttasitt ""Macky"" Pottasak is a typical candidate of Thailand's People's Party: young, idealistic and hardworking.

He gave up a career in TV drama production in Bangkok to run in the last election, winning a rural seat near his home city of Nakhon Ratchasima from an old, established political family. He has adopted the hat and flag of Luffy, the main character in the Japanese anime series One Piece, which has featured in recent youth protests in Asia. He makes light-hearted videos about his party's policies every day, which are getting millions of views on social media.

""Politics is something past generations made boring. I want to make it fun,"" he says. ""That's why I brought in Luffy and my video mini-series. We don't have money to buy votes. We are just ordinary citizens, but with a strong determination to solve the long-standing problems. I think the villagers can see that.""

Opinion polls suggest that much of the Thai public agrees with the People's Party. They are polling consistently ahead of their rivals as the election on Sunday draws near.

But in Thailand, winning an election is never enough.

The last one, less than three years ago, produced a surprise win for the progressive Move Forward party, which had campaigned on promises of root-and-branch political and economic reforms. These included making Thailand's powerful military, and its largest businesses, more accountable, and reducing the heavy punishments under the notorious lese majeste law.

But powerful conservative forces, in particular the unelected senate and the constitutional court, blocked Move Forward from forming a government, dissolved the party and banned its leaders from politics. The court ruled that its proposals for the lese majeste law amounted to an attempt to overthrow the entire political system.

Now, after three tumultuous years of short-lived coalition administrations, the sacking of two prime ministers by the constitutional court and a border war with Cambodia, the reformists are making another bid for power, this time under a new name, the People's Party.

Their youthful energy and idealism still draw large and excited crowds. At a rally in Nakhon Ratchasima the new party leader, Natthaphong Ruengpanyawut, a 38-year-old former software engineer, was mobbed like a rock star, people queueing for selfies with him and wrapping him in garlands of flowers.

Macky (centre) is running for a rural seat in northeastern Thailand

Macky and two assistants tour his constituency on e-scooters, passing irrigation canals, rice fields and the simple wooden houses characteristic of north-eastern Thai villages, listening to the concerns of the residents. They tell a story of a society under acute economic stress, where the old engines of growth have stopped working.

The village head La-or Kohsantea says there are few decent jobs in the area, so young people have to leave to find work. ""No-one has helped us with the problem of poverty,"" she says. Thailand has one of the highest levels of household debt in Asia. GDP is growing at less than 2% a year, far lower than neighbouring countries.

Kritsana Lohsantea, 28, is asking Macky to help him get a modest social security payment when the electronics factory he works at closes down later this year. 

Like many young Thais in rural areas he left school at 15 with few qualifications, but the low-skilled manufacturing jobs which helped Thailand grow rapidly 30 or 40 years ago are now moving to lower-cost locations like Vietnam.

Macky has also noticed how many elderly people there are in the area. Thailand's population has been falling for five years. Last year the number of births fell 10 %, the highest rate in the world. 

With so many young people leaving the village, Macky is proposing local training and a better online system for organising care-givers, to look after house-bound old people who no longer have family members living with them.

The People's Party stands out for its ambition to transform Thailand. 

It has prioritised amending the constitution, which was drafted under military rule and gives a lot of power to unelected agencies like the constitutional court to constrain elected governments. The party wants to streamline the country's extensive bureaucracy, modernise its education system, and curb the power of the military and the biggest businesses. It also supports amending the military-drafted constitution, a question which will be put in a referendum at the same time as the election.

Its two main rivals, Bhumjaithai, the party of Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul, and Pheu Thai, the party of former prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra, have focused instead on more crowd-pleasing policies.

Anutin has highlighted his nationalist credentials, pointing to the hard line he took against Cambodia in the border war, and his support for the military.

PM Anutin promised to protect Thailand's sovereignty against a backdrop showing him visiting Thai soldiers at the border

""I promise you I will protect our soil with my life,"" he told the crowd at a rally in Bangkok. ""If you want a prime minister the enemy cannot intimidate, choose my party."" 

He has also persuaded many MPs from other parties to defect to him, and recruited technocrats known for their competence, to build Bhumjaithai up into a leading conservative political force.

Pheu Thai, which built its past popularity on eye-catching populist policies has promised to create nine new millionaires – in Thai baht – every day through a national prize draw. Both parties are offering subsidies and cash handouts, but many economists argue this kind of instant help does little so solve the deep structural problems confronting Thailand.

""This is barking up the wrong tree,"" says Apichat Satitniramai, a professor of economics at Thammasat University. ""These stimulus packages are like painkillers, which are less effective the more we use them.""

In his view the People's Party is the only one thinking long-term, rather than just about what is needed to win the election.

Thanya Doksone/BBC

Bhumjaithai is one of the main rivals of the People's Party in this election 

From the moment the People's Party was founded in 2017, then called Future Forward, by Thanathorn Juangroongruangkit, a charismatic and wealthy entrepreneur, it was viewed as a threat by powerful conservative figures.

Thailand was under military rule at the time. The then-army chief compared the party to the armed communist insurgency of the Cold War. Some feared Thanathorn's argument that everything in Thailand needed reforming, might eventually include the monarchy, which conservatives say must be untouchable.

After the party's surprisingly strong performance in the 2019 election, the constitutional court, which had already disqualified other parties and politicians seen as a threat to the status quo, barred Thanathorn from political office for 10 years. This was over his ownership of shares in a small publishing company, which was judged to violate rules against politicians controlling news media.

Future Forward was dissolved by the court the following year, a verdict which ignited large-scale student protests that lasted until the end of the year, and for the first time, called for reform of the monarchy.

By the time of the next election in 2023 the public hunger for change was even greater, delivering the successor party, Move Forward, its unexpected win, followed by the almost inevitable dissolution.

So, all eyes are on what happens after voting this weekend. If, as the polls suggest, the People's Party gets even more seats than last time, it will be well ahead of its closest rival, though the polls show none of the parties getting an overall majority of the 500 seats in parliament. This time the senate is no longer allowed to take part in choosing the next government.

Yet everyone in Thailand expects some kind of move to block the People's Party once again. A case has been filed against 44 of its leading figures - including 15 of their parliamentary candidates - with the National Anti-Corruption Commission, over their personal endorsement of the lese majeste proposals. 

That could be used to bar them all from politics. Two of their candidates are also facing jail time under that law.

""They are afraid of us,"" Thanathorn told the BBC, as he prepared to join a People's Party campaign bus. ""They are afraid of change. They want tomorrow to be just like yesterday. They think dissolving our parties, banning our leaders from politics, would make us smaller.

""In fact, we are getting bigger.""

Even if his party is allowed to join a government, the constraints on what they can do in office remain in place. That is why they have made reforming the constitution such a high priority, to dilute or end the extraordinary powers that deeply conservative institutions like the constitutional court have to unseat elected governments.

In that they are joined by rival party Pheu Thai, which saw two of its prime ministers removed from office by the court during their two years in power. But there are many hurdles to getting a new charter. The process could take years, or it could easily be blocked.

""If Thailand was a functional democracy, none of this would have happened,"" says Siripan Nogsuan Sawasdee, a political scientist from Chulalongkorn University.

""We have regular elections, sometimes punctuated by military coups. But elections only determine the representatives in the lower house of parliament. They do not determine who governs. That is determined by elite networks, and unelected institutions which have played a veto role against the will of the voters.""

Deividas Skebas stabbed Lilia Valutyte outside the shop where her mother worked in 2022

A man has been found guilty of murdering a nine-year-old girl as she played in the street.

Deividas Skebas stabbed Lilia Valutyte in a random attack outside the shop where her mother worked in Boston, Lincolnshire, on 28 July 2022.

The 26-year-old admitted killing Lilia but denied her murder, claiming his responsibility was diminished by his mental state. However, a jury at Lincoln Crown Court convicted him following a trial.

Skebas, formerly of Thorold Street, Boston, was remanded in custody. He will be sentenced on 25 February. 

Lincolnshire Police

Deividas Skebas will be sentenced at Lincoln Crown Court on 25 February

Lilia had been playing with a hula hoop with a friend outside her mother's shop on Fountain Lane.

Shortly after 18:20 BST, the pair were approached by Skebas who reached out and stabbed Lilia once in the chest.

The 'heinous' child killing that shook a town and the fight for justice

Her mother, Lina Savicke, remembers hearing Lilia call her name before she rushed into the street to see her daughter still clutching the hoop and, moments later, collapsing into her arms.

The court heard that, despite the efforts of an off-duty police officer, doctors and paramedics, Lilia died within an hour of being stabbed. 

Skebas, who had no connection to Lilia, was arrested at his home two days after the attack, and the paring knife he had recently bought from a local shop was found behind a radiator.

He was found unfit to stand trial in the months after the stabbing and was later transferred to Rampton high security hospital.

In July 2023, a jury found Skebas carried out the act of killing Lilia, and, two years later, following an improvement in his mental health, it was decided he could face a murder trial.

During the trial, the jury was told Skebas was assessed by three psychiatrists.

All three doctors agreed Skebas had schizophrenia and was showing symptoms of psychosis on the day he killed Lilia.

But the prosecution rejected Skebas's claim of diminished responsibility and alleged the killing was ""deliberate and planned"". 

Lina Savicke

Lilia was a ""beautiful soul with a strong character"", her stepfather Aurelijus Savickas said

Prosecutor Christopher Donnellan KC told the court it was a ""wicked act"", adding Skebas knew he was ""killing a child"".

The jury found Skebas guilty of Lilia's murder by an 11 to one majority verdict after deliberating for more than seven hours.

Skebas appeared on a video link from Rampton Hospital to hear the verdict and did not appear to show any emotion.

Lincolnshire Police

Deividas Skebas was arrested in Boston on 30 July 2022, two days after the stabbing

He stared straight ahead as the statement of Lilia's mother, Lina Savicke, was read out.

It began by stating Lilia would have turned 13 on Monday this week.

""Over these years of loss, both I and my entire family have lived through so much.

""Tears and pain cannot wash away everything we feel.""

The statement added: ""What parent ever thinks they will have to bury their own child?"" 

Speaking in court, Aurelijus Savickas, Lilia's stepdad, said: ""I came into her life when she was just three years young. 

""From that moment on, we loved our journey together through the good days and the bad.

""I loved her as my own. She was a beautiful soul with a strong character and strong personality.""

Lina Savicke

Lilia ""loved drawing and painting"" and had a wall in her bedroom where she could paint freely, her stepfather said

As the family impact statements were read out in court, several people could be seen wiping tears from their faces.

The judge Mr Justice Choudhury excused the jury from further jury service for ten years.

Addressing them, he said: ""I appreciate it has been a difficult experience for you.""

Det Chief Insp Jennifer Lovett, from Lincolnshire Police, said: ""It's taken us three-and-a-half years to bring Skebas to justice.

""It's not lost on me how difficult that must have been for Lilia's family.""

She added: ""It's been one of our most high-profile investigations that Lincolnshire Police has had.""

Molly-Mae Hague has been open about her struggles with her first pregnancy

Reality TV personality Molly-Mae Hague has announced she is pregnant with a second child.

""Soon to be four,"" she wrote on Instagram accompanying footage taken last week at home with a visible baby bump, kissing partner Tommy Fury and playing with their three-year-old Bambi.

The pregnancy comes after the two Love Island contestants rekindled their relationship last May following a nine-month split, which both attributed to professional boxer Fury's drinking.

Hague has been open with her fans about her struggles with pregnancy, childbirth and motherhood, describing having her first child as challenging at times. 

News of her second pregnancy was welcomed by friends and followers alike.

""Congratulations and you look amazing,"" Hague's sister-in-law Paris commented.

""SO happy for you,"" wrote TV presenter Rochelle Humes, describing it as ""gorgeous news"".

""Huge congratulations to you all,"" fellow TV personality Scarlett Moffat reacted.

Hague and Fury got together during the fifth series of Love Island in 2019, and their relationship continued through the birth of their first child and engagement, both in 2023.

However, the following year the two split up, with Hague saying at the time that she ""never imagined our story would end, especially not this way"".

Fury, the half-brother of former heavyweight world champion Tyson Fury, 

later told the BBC that turning to alcohol following an injury had ultimately led to their relationship ending

.

But less than a year later, Hague confirmed they were back together, saying Fury had not drunk alcohol for four months and that ""things are looking so much better"".

Hague said she had ""extreme emotions"" early on in her pregnancy with Bambi and had been crying every day.

She also recounted suffering ""excruciating"" pain during childbirth, telling fans: ""I spent five to six hours rolling around in the bed crying in agony.""

Hague explained she then received an epidural which allowed her to enjoy the pushing part of labour.

The reality TV star also expressed challenges during the first few weeks after Bambi's birth, including struggling to produce breast milk. 

""I'm not going to beat around the bush... I was not prepared,"" she told fans during a Q&A, adding: ""She's completely and utterly worth it all though. Every single hard moment!""

Elton John and David Furnish (right) at Paris Fashion Week in January

The filmmaker and husband of Sir Elton John has said the couple have been ""profoundly affected"" by not knowing how many times they were targeted by the Daily Mail, a court has heard.

David Furnish and Sir Elton are among seven people, including Prince Harry, Elizabeth Hurley and Baroness Doreen Lawrence, suing the publisher of that paper and the Mail on Sunday for breaches of privacy.

The couple's claim relates to 10 articles published between 2002 to 2015, which they say were a result of unlawful information gathering by the papers.

Their publisher, Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL), denies all allegations of unlawful information gathering.

In a witness statement read out at the High Court in London, Furnish said he and his partner had a long and difficult history with the Mail.

He said the paper had, despite partly moving with the times, ""published countless judgemental, and narrow-minded stories"" that were ""clearly designed to undermine who we are and how we live our lives"".

He said one story, published in December 2010, included the publication of their son's birth certificate before they had received it.

""The world had no idea we were having a baby"", Furnish said, adding that the process leading up to the birth was run ""like a military operation"".

""For The Mail to access it before the parents themselves - it was outrageous, invasive, and upsetting. It left us asking, 'If they can get this, what else can they get?'""

Another article, from August 2015, referred to an urgent ambulance journey during which, Furnish's statement said, ""I had never heard anyone in so much pain as Elton was then"".

Referring to the incident, Furnish said ""none of this was publicised - it was completely private"".

He said at the time the couple had assumed the information in the article came from a leak ""within the ambulance or hospital, somebody being indiscreet"".

""Elton and I are profoundly affected by the uncertainty of not knowing how many times we were targeted, especially in relation to Elton's medicals"", Furnish said.

""We still don't know what was really done to us,"" he added.

ANL strongly denies wrongdoing, with lawyers for the publisher previously telling the court that the claims made by Furnish and Sir Elton are ""unsupported by any evidence before the court and utterly baseless"".

The trial continues and is expected to end in March.

Watch: Bad Bunny on how he's preparing for Super Bowl performance

Puerto Rican rapper Bad Bunny says he's trying to stay calm ahead of Sunday's Super Bowl, Half Time Show - but it isn't working out.

""Last night, I couldn't sleep,"" he said during a press conference for the show, admitting that he'd often woken up ""thinking about the Super Bowl at 4am"".

The singer, who won album of the year at Sunday's Grammy Awards, will be the first artist ever to perform the half time show entirely in Spanish. 

His selection in September prompted opposition in right-wing media circles, where it was noted he had been critical of President Trump and his administration's immigration policies.

The controversy even led one conservative organisation in the US to plan an alternative show during half-time - starring singer and Trump ally Kid Rock. 

""I think the president would much prefer a Kid Rock performance over Bad Bunny, I must say that,"" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said on Thursday. 

The Global Story podcast: Will Bad Bunny take on MAGA at the Super Bowl?

Bad Bunny did not address the bubbling tensions over his performance at Thursday's press conference, where hosts Zane Lowe and Ebro Darden flattered him with softball questions.

However, security at the press event was tight. Journalists were required to pass through security scanners; and their bags were searched a second time as they waited for Bad Bunny to arrive.

Despite that, the musician seemed relaxed on stage, as he stretched languorously across a sofa in a long faux-fur coat, answering questions in a mix of English and Spanish.

And he hinted his performance would be more about unity and healing than spreading division.

""I know that the world is gonna be happy at this Sunday, and they're gonna have fun, and they're gonna dance and they're gonna have a good time.""

Getty Images

The singer is one of the biggest-selling artists in the world

The Super Bowl Half Time Show is one of the most-watched music events in the world, regularly drawing more than 100 million viewers in America alone.

Bad Bunny noted that he'd had to prepare his 13-minute segment in the middle of an extensive world tour, and joked that the pressure had eroded his competitive edge.

""I'm not even playing that much dominoes, and that is killing me, bro,"" he said. 

""In the last three games, I got a zero,"" he said. ""I need to talk to my therapist.""

Asked about the possibility of special guests on Sunday night, he refused to spill any secrets. 

""You know that's something I'm not going to tell you,"" he laughed. ""I don't know why you asked that.""

Finally, as he reflected on the biggest week of his career, the star said that taking to ""the biggest stage in the world"" confirmed something he'd long believed. 

""You always have to be proud about who you are and feel comfortable being yourself. Feel proud about your history where you from, but don't let that limit yourself.""

How can I watch Bad Bunny's half time show?

Getty Images

The half time has previously starred artists including Michael Jackson, The Rolling Stones, Beyoncé, Lady Gaga, Kendrick Lamar and Rihanna

Bad Bunny will take to the stage midway through the Super Bowl.

The game starts at 23:30 UK time (18:30 in San Francisco), and half time depends on how the game progresses. That means the performance could start any time between 01:00-01:30 UK time.

In the US, the match is being screened on NBC and streamed on Peacock. Viewers in the UK can follow it on Channel 5, Sky Sports and Now TV from 22:30.

If you don't want to stay up and watch the concert live, the NFL typically puts the whole show on YouTube immediately after its broadcast, and Apple Music subscribers can watch it back in spatial audio.

Who is Bad Bunny?

Getty Images

The 31-year-old has become one of the biggest musical stars in the world

Bad Bunny is the stage name of Puerto Rican singer Benito Antonio Martínez Ocasio - whose genre-bending songs and convention-flouting lyrics have made him a global star.

Since 2020, he's been the most-played artist on Spotify in four separate years (a clean sweep that was only broken by Taylor Swift).

With his doleful singing voice and a prolific work rate, he's transformed the sound of  música urbana, combining elements of trap, hip-hop and R&B with the traditional sounds of Latin pop.

He got his start singing in a church choir at the age of five, and earned his nom de plume from a childhood photo of him scowling in a bunny costume.

As a teenager, he studied audiovisual communication at the University of Puerto Rico; and worked as a bagger at a grocery store to pay for recording sessions. 

One of his early songs, Diles, caught the ear of DJ Luian, who offered him a record deal.

Audiences instantly fell for his sound, where hard hitting beats and boisterous music contrast with the star's low-key delivery.

By the time Western audiences discovered him - via a guest verse on Cardi B's 2018 hit I Like It - Bad Bunny had already racked up 16 Top 40 hits on the US Latin charts.

He released his debut album, x100pre, on Christmas Eve 2018, to universal acclaim. 

Showcasing his versatility, its songs ranged from the pop-punk of Tenemos Que Hablar to the reggaeton ballad Si Estuviésemos Juntos and the avowedly political Estamos Bien, which became an anthem for Puerto Rico after it was devastated by Hurricane Maria.

In 2020, his third album, El Último Tour del Mundo, became the first number one on the Billboard chart to be completely recorded in Spanish. Every subsequent album has also topped the US charts.

Along the way, he established a reputation for colouring outside the lines. 

Instead of singing about seducing women, he talked about empowering them. He dressed in drag and wrestled in the WWE. He was a prominent figure in protests that led to the resignation of Puerto Rican governor Ricardo Rosselló, and he's been a vocal critic of the Trump administration's immigration policies.

Getty Images

The star also appeared with Shakira and Jennifer Lopez during their Super Bowl performance in 2020

Last year, he opted not to bring his world tour to the US mainland, saying he worried his fans would be targeted by immigration officers. And instead, he hosted what nearly amounted to a residency in Puerto Rico, a US territory.

After winning a Grammy Award earlier this week, 

he declared ""ICE out""

, and spoke passionately about immigrants' contribution to society.

Staying true to his roots, that Grammy-winning album, Debí Tirar Más Fotos, is both a celebration of Puerto Rico's culture and a warning against the island's exploitation.

A generous and charismatic performer, he's bound to light up the Super Bowl stage. But his mere presence had infuriated US conservatives.

In January, President Trump said he would not attend the Super Bowl, partly because of Bad Bunny and the pop-punk band Green Day, who will open the event.

""I'm anti-them. I think it's a terrible choice,"" he said. ""All it does is sow hatred.""

Who else is performing at the Super Bowl?

Getty Images

Charlie Puth, Coco Jones and Brandi Carlile will all perform in the pre-game show

Pop star Charlie Puth will perform the US National Anthem before the game, marking his Super Bowl debut.

The 34-year-old joked that he'd been practicing ""in the shower"", which has ""a similar reverb"" to Levi's stadium - ""but a little wetter"".

Coco Jones will also sing Lift Every Voice, sometimes referred to as the black national anthem. 

The song, originally written as a poem in 1899, has been part of the pre-game show since 2021, when it was added in response to the Black Lives Matter movement.

And country star Brandi Carlile is confirmed to perform America the Beautiful. She said she hoped it would be a unifying moment.

""I would love for people to interpret the song is more of a prayer than a boast,"" she said.

""This is a song about a country, a beautiful country, that ebbs and flows in terms of hope, and it's a work in progress. The song believes we can get there, and I believe we can get there.""

Why is the half time show so important?

Rihanna revealed her pregnancy during the 2023 Super Bowl show

The Super Bowl is the most-watched programme on US television - and the half-time show regularly pulls in more viewers than the match itself.

Last year, Kendrick Lamar broke audience records, with 133.5 million people tuning in . Even when the bookings aren't as stellar (like Maroon 5 in 2019) the viewership has been close to 100 million.

The show has produced a stream of iconic moments over the years, from Prince playing Purple Rain in the middle of a thunderstorm, to Katy Perry's hapless ""left shark"", who became an instant meme after forgetting their dance moves.

The exposure and publicity stemming from a Super Bowl appearance is so valuable that many performers, including Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars and Rihanna, play for no fee. 

However, every performer receives a ""union scale"" payment of about $1,000 (£738) per day; and the NFL picks up a hefty bill for staging the show.

For example, the 13-minute show performed by Jennifer Lopez and Shakira in 2020 cost approximately $1 million per minute, according to Reuters - and the league also pays for travel and accommodation expenses.

Reece Prescod on Enhanced Games: 'I want to be able to run the fastest time possible'

By

Dan Roan

Sports editor

Published

5 February 2026

Former Great Britain sprinter Reece Prescod has given the clearest indication yet that he will take performance-enhancing drugs as part of the controversial Enhanced Games - saying: ""If that's something that will take me to the next level, I'm not against it.""

Prescod, who announced his retirement last August after a career in which he took part in three World Championships and the Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games, added that it would be ""interesting to know that's how fast I can run with the additional help"".

The Enhanced Games permit athletes, under medical supervision, to take drugs banned in mainstream sport.

Last month, having signed up to the project after retiring from elite sprinting, Prescod told the BBC that he 

would not take performance-enhancing drugs

.

But speaking in Abu Dhabi at an Enhanced Games training camp before its inaugural competition in Las Vegas in May, the former Olympian now says he is open to doing so.

""I will have a conversation with the doctors and see if that's going to be part of my journey, but as it stands right now, my initial focus is to train"" he told BBC Sport.

""I've got the medical team to support me and if that's something I feel like I can take, that will take me to the next level, I'm not against it.""

""I want to be able to run the fastest time as possible and push my body to the limits.""

'Mind-boggling'

When asked how he thought it would feel if he takes some of the drugs being made available - which include steroids, growth hormone and testosterone - Prescod said: ""It's quite mind-boggling, if I'm being honest.

""Obviously during my career, I abided by the rules. I never had any sort of violations, missed tests, anything like that.

""If that's the journey I go down with enhancements here and I run extremely fast, it'll just be interesting to know that's how fast I can run with the additional help.""

During three months of training in the United Arab Emirates, 39 athletes in sprinting, swimming and weightlifting will be offered performance-enhancing drugs that are approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

Organisers say the competitors will undergo strict medical assessments at a hospital on the outskirts of Abu Dhabi, and claim the event - which has a prize pot of $25m and offers appearance fees and bonuses of up to $1m for breaking a world record - will deliver transparency and health safety by removing the stigma of enhancement.

But it has also been condemned by a range of sports and anti-doping bodies for normalising doping, endangering athletes' health, and harming the integrity of sport.

Last year, World Aquatics became the first international sport federation to ban athletes, coaches and officials from its events if they have taken part in the Enhanced Games.

When asked if he was worried about any long-term side effects that could harm his health, Prescod said: ""With anything in life, any sort of medication, there's always a risk with that kind of situation.

""I trust in the doctors and I trust what's going on here.""

The fourth-fastest British man over 100 metres, with a personal best of 9.93 seconds, Prescod says the prospect of financial security was a major factor in his decision. But he has been criticised by UK Athletics, which said it was ""disappointed"" by the sprinter signing up.

""Obviously there's been some controversy around the decision and I can understand everyone's entitled to their opinion but ultimately it's my decision - I'm going to stand by it,"" he said.

""They'd probably be better to actually speak to all the athletes and try and improve the service that they're given. They need to focus on improving that. 

""What people are not necessarily understanding is that the Enhanced Games is a different format. It's a different entity, where we have our own rules.""

'Throwing stones'

Enhanced Games chief executive and co-founder Max Martin told BBC Sport he was ""very excited about expanding beyond the three sports that we're currently offering"".

He said: ""What else can we do in long distance triathlons? What can we do in cycling? What can we do in marathon running?

""We're speaking to athletes already outside of the core three sports.""

The prospect of athletes from more sports participating in the event has dismayed UK Anti-Doping chief executive Jane Rumble, who said: ""I'm really disappointed in the round about the Enhanced Games, and about the sports that are taking part, so all I can do is emphasise my deep concern about the health risks and safety risks and encourage everyone to stay 100% clean and true.

""The concept flies in the face of what sport is all about.

""The key concern that I've got about the potential impact is on the next generation of young people who may tune in and watch. 

""I believe it sends a dangerous message about PEDs [performance-enhancing drugs] with little if anything said about the health risks associated, and those risks are significant.""

When asked if athletes could be put at risk, Martin said: ""I think there is a risk with anything in life. 

""There's people every year that die from taking aspirin, but we take the right precautions under the highest clinical and medical standards to mitigate that risk as much as we possibly can.""

Backed by investors including US tech billionaire and libertarian Peter Thiel, and a venture fund co-funded by Donald Trump Jnr, the Enhanced Games' website is already advertising a product it says will boost testosterone and longevity. Martin acknowledges the sale of lifestyle health products will be a key part of its business model.

""We utilise sports to create awareness that performance enhancements under the right clinical and medical supervision can actually be very good for people"" he claimed.

""And once we have that awareness, we give people access to those performance enhancements.""

When asked if criticism of the Enhanced Games has troubled him, Martin said: ""No it doesn't. We are not trying to interfere with the current system. We're not out there throwing stones at the traditional sporting organisations like they're doing it at us. ""

'I want to move away from the term doping' - Proud

Olympic swimmer Ben Proud was the first British athlete to join the Enhanced Games, with governing body Aquatics GB saying it was ""immensely disappointed"", condemning his decision ""in the strongest terms"".

""I knew signing up to this was going to absolutely ruin my credibility as a traditional swimmer,"" he said. ""If I came here and did it 'unenhanced', going back to the traditional world, people are going to see me as a villain or a dirty swimmer or a cheat.

""That's never how I wanted to have my reputation. I did my career to the highest standards. World Aquatics have put the ban on everyone who endorses the Enhanced Games [so] I will never swim in the traditional sense again and therefore the question is; why wouldn't I mould myself to these new set of rules? 

""Why wouldn't I take part in the study [and] be a part of the enhanced programme to the full extent?""

When asked if his decision was based purely on money, Proud said: ""I built this skill and that skill had no value in swimming anymore.

""Even though I did all these things, I rarely received any sort of compensation. And you start to think, especially as a 30-31 year old, what use is this? What's the point of spending 15 years building a skill just to retire and forget about it for the rest of my life?

""It very much felt like I was the right person at the right time to take advantage of what was in front of me by using the skill I've developed - and hopefully be able to end my entire swimming career feeling secure financially, for my family and my future family.""","im-not-against-it---fomer-gb-sprinter-prescod-on-taking-drugs-for-enhanced-games",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,True,True,NULL

Alton Towers will not allow some people with conditions like autism, ADHD and anxiety to use their disability queuing system this February half-term.

Merlin Entertainments provides a ride access pass to help visitors to its theme parks who have a difficulty queuing because of their disability or medical needs.

They say the number of people requesting the pass has been increasing, adding that disabled visitors have said the system ""simply isn't working for them"" and that ""queue times for these guests have increased"".

A new restriction will also apply at Chessington World of Adventures and Windsor Legoland, as part of a trial to reduce the number of people who get access to the pass.

Neurodiverse people can become overwhelmed or distressed when surrounded by large numbers of people, which can bring on sensory overload or panic attacks.

Up until now, people who have a ""difficulty with crowds"" have qualified for the ride access pass, but only those with ""difficulty standing,"" ""level access"" or ""urgent toilet needs"" will do so during the half-term trial. 

Others will have to queue as normal.

Merlin says it offers support to people with difficulty with crowds through ""a range of reasonable adjustments"".

'No one likes queuing'

Henry Shelford, chief executive of the ADHD UK charity, said ""a group of people will be excluded because of this lack of accommodation"".

""It's different from a child just not being happy about it, because no one likes queuing,"" he said.

""When a kid has ADHD, their energy and their focus makes [queuing] just impossible.

""As an adult with ADHD, I can tell you there's a whole lot of stuff I haven't done because I can't face the queuing.

""I have a need to move all the time, and being penned in in that way is very difficult for me as an adult. And it's near impossible for children and others.""

All visitors to Alton Towers can opt to purchase a ""Fastrack"" pass to skip the queues, but these start at an extra £35 on top of the ticket price. 

The change follows an update by the disability access card provider Nimbus, which is recognised by many attractions and events.

Nimbus has split its former ""standing and queuing"" card section into two separate symbols: ""difficulty standing"" (a physical need) and ""difficulty with crowds"" (often linked to neurodivergence or anxiety).

During half‑term, Merlin says new eligibility for the ride access pass is being trialled. 

Those whose Nimbus card shows only the ""difficulty with crowds"" icon will be asked to visit guest services for personalised support instead. 

The approach will be reviewed after February before the theme park opens fully in March.

Jonathan and Cheryl Willis contacted 

BBC Your Voice

 when they heard about the changes to the ride access pass for half-term.

They had tickets to go with their son Joshua, who has autism, but say there is no way he will be able to join the main queues.

""It's his special place,"" Cheryl said. 

""He has a special interest in rollercoasters - he's going to be absolutely devastated if he can't go.""

Jonathan Willis

Jonathan and Cheryl Willis say Alton Towers is their son Joshua's ""special place""

Five-year-old Joshua also has mobility issues, but after the changes to the Nimbus card scheme, his parents said he had only been allocated the ""difficulty with crowds"" icon on his card.

Cheryl said not being able to take her son to Alton Towers would be particularly difficult as he is not currently in nursery or school, and otherwise struggles to leave the house.

""He's learning to be out and about in the world,"" she said. 

""They don't understand how massive a problem this is causing to people like us.""

Rob Smith, chief operating officer at Merlin Entertainments, said growing demand had led to issues for people using the passes, but recognised the suggested eligibility changes had ""raised concerns for some guests"".

""Our commitment to supporting neurodiverse guests and those with mental health needs remains,"" he said. 

""We are listening carefully to this feedback and are committed to keeping this approach under review ahead of our main season openings in March.

""We remain deeply committed to creating inclusive experiences and ensuring all guests feel supported when visiting our attractions.""

Today, the Metropolitan Police has launched a criminal investigation into Peter Mandelson after new files released seemed to suggest he had passed sensitive government information to Jeffrey Epstein. 

Lord Mandelson has resigned from the House of Lords following the latest revelations, though he retains the right to use the title of Lord.

The government say they are moving to draft legislation that will strip him of his title and the opposition are expected to try and force the government to release papers relating to Mandelson’s hiring as US ambassador. 

Adam and Chris are joined by Dominic Casciani, BBC home affairs correspondent and senior royal correspondent Daniela Relph who has the latest on seeming revelations about Sarah Ferguson.

As the government prepares to introduce a strategy to boost fostering in England, Amol speaks to foster carer and author Louise Allen about the crisis in the system and what it will take to fix it.  

At the end of March 2024 there were 83,630 children in care in England, of whom 56,390 were being fostered, but there is a shortfall of around 6,000 foster carers nationwide. 

In this episode Louise explains why we need to be more honest about the realities of caring for often vulnerable kids and focus on retaining foster carers rather than recruiting new ones.  

She also explains why there needs to be more practical support like providing a cleaner for every fostering household so that they can focus on emotionally supporting the children in their care.

Ireland were beaten 36-14 by France in the 2026 Six Nations opener

On an earlier than usual Six Nations opening night, Ireland fluffed their lines in Paris on Thursday, beginning their 2026 campaign with a resounding 36-14 defeat by France that was as bruising to the ego as it was the body. 

These sides may have won the past four titles in this competition between them but, for the second season in a row, there was only one winner when they went head-to-head.

An Ireland performance that was described by their head coach Andy Farrell as lacking ""intent"" continued a number of worrying trends from both the autumn and prior.

Coming into the game as considerable underdogs, the head coach had tried to reframe the changing narrative as his side now being the hunter rather than hunted.

For much of the 80 minutes in Paris, they looked like easy prey for superior opposition.

""It's coming again next week [against Italy],"" former Ireland lock Donncha O'Callaghan told BBC Sport.

""This Irish team are on the ropes and everyone is coming after them - they might be the hunted again. They have to find the answers because Six Nations rugby is ruthless and they need to stop the rot.""

France did not concede a penalty in the game until the 45th minute

With Farrell rolling the dice in his selection - dropping James Lowe as well as giving Cian Prendergast a rare start - there were interesting subplots aplenty as the game neared. 

Such was the nature of the Paris performance, however, that few such themes could be given fair scrutiny. 

Ireland had picked a team to compete in the air but rarely challenged in that regard with the new-look back three of Jamie Osborne, Tommy O'Brien and Jacob Stockdale largely on the periphery.

While the loss of both usual starting props to injury, as well as two back-ups on the loose-head side, was unwanted, it gave the opportunity for others to step up and show what they can do, yet the set-piece was rendered a virtual non-factor. 

Indeed, Ireland won a scrum penalty in the 45th minute but, such was the lack of pressure elsewhere, it was the first time Les Bleus had drawn a whistle from Karl Dickson. 

Discipline had been a key area to improve after the autumn but, while Ireland did concede only six penalties, they frequently did not get close enough to infringe either, with 38 missed tackles on the night. 

Ireland's failure to get to grips with the non-negotiables - what Farrell called the ""main part of the game"" - left little point in sifting through much else.

""I think you make your own luck in this game,"" said Farrell. 

""Without the ball, I thought we lost that battle in the first half. The things like the high ball and winning the scraps on the floor, running through tackles or missing tackles etc - that's the main part of the game.

""We certainly came off second best in that regard in the first half. Our response was gallant, but that's not what we want to be, we don't want to be a responding team. We needed to show it from the get go.""

Ireland again look level below the world's best

Irrespective of another World Cup quarter-final exit in 2023 - against, it should be remembered, a New Zealand side who produced a brilliant performance on the night - Ireland felt on par with the very best in the game just a little over two years ago.

They appeared to put paid to any notion of a World Cup hangover when they opened the 2024 Six Nations against France, winning 38-17 against 14 men in Marseille, but it has subsequently been a very different story. 

In the nine games since against the four sides currently above them in the world rankings, Ireland have won two and lost seven.

Five of the losses, and none of the wins, have been by margins of 10 points or more and there were times, especially when 29-0 down early in the second half, when this appeared the widest gap of the lot. 

Ireland remain admirably consistent in winning the games that they should win. But winning those that they could win increasingly looks like a bridge too far. 

Selection policy increasingly called into question

Ireland trailed 29-0 before Nick Timoney's try just before the hour-mark

Few sides in the world could cope with losing three players in one position, especially one as specialised as loose-head prop.

Jeremy Loughman had just five caps before Thursday's game, while Michael Milne's only previous Tests were as a replacement against Georgia and Portugal. 

While that certainly speaks to Ireland's injury problems, it is worth noting that even before Ireland's loose-head stocks were decimated, Andrew Porter's two primary back-ups, Jack Boyle and Paddy McCarthy, still have just eight caps between them.

That can be said to be a legacy of the continued reliance on Cian Healy right up to the point of his retirement last year but the situation in not confined to just one position.

Injuries are inevitable. Yet in the main, Ireland's squad - outside their starting XV and a handful of select others - feels underexposed to the highest level of Test rugby.

For instance, reserve scrum-half Craig Casey has been part of the squad for almost five years and won his 25th cap from the bench in the Stade de France but has never started a Six Nations game against opposition other than Italy - he saw only seven minutes of action on Thursday.

Nick Timoney led the resurgence off the bench. The unwaveringly consistent Ulster back row scored his side's first points of the game and led the belated charge at France. 

Almost five years after his debut, and six months beyond his 30th birthday, this was his first Six Nations cap.

""You could use the excuses and they are there, the injuries, we haven't the depth of squad to go that deep, but there's been a fundamental thought of relying on the Leinster base and for the last few years that hasn't gone as well for the Leinster team,"" said O'Callaghan.

""You're trying to integrate players and it's just been too much of a gap.""

Leicester City have been docked six points by the English Football League for breaching financial rules.

The deduction will be applied immediately meaning the Foxes fall from 17th to 20th in the Championship and are only outside the relegation zone on goal difference.

It comes after 

Leicester were charged by the Premier League

 in May for a profit and sustainability (PSR) breach in the three years up to 2023-24.

Leicester were relegated from the top flight last season and are currently without a permanent manager after Marti Cifuentes was sacked in January.

In a statement Leicester said they were ""disappointed"" with the decision, branding it ""disproportionate"".

""While the commission's findings significantly reduced the unprecedented scale of the sanction originally sought by the Premier League, the recommendation remains disproportionate and does not adequately reflect the mitigating factors presented, the importance of which cannot be overstated given the potential impact on our sporting ambitions this season,"" the statement said.

""We are now reviewing the decision in full and considering the options available to us. 

""We remain committed to engaging constructively and ensuring that any action is fair, proportionate and determined through the appropriate processes.""

Leicester City: When You're Smiling

Under PSR, Premier League clubs cannot lose more than £105m over three years but the figure is reduced by £22m for every season a club spends outside the top flight.

Leicester's accounts for the period ending 30 June, 2024, showed a loss of £19.4m.

In their 2022-23 accounts Leicester confirmed an £89.7m loss while in the 12 months up to May 2022 they lost a club record £92.5m.

Those figures do not take into account 'add backs' - costs such as building infrastructure and investing in women's football that the Premier League and EFL view as in general interests of clubs.

Leicester are winless in their last four Championship fixtures, losing three. Interim head coach Andy King takes the Foxes to face Birmingham City on Saturday (15:01).

Leicester are now only outside the relegation zone on goal difference

Despite being charged by the Premier League, the EFL took on the case following their relegation to the second tier.

Although the Premier League had jurisdiction, the Foxes have been sanctioned under EFL PSR rules.

Leicester had argued their case should be have been considered over a 36-month period rather than 37 months caused by a delay in submitting their accounts for 2023-24.

The commission ruled that it should be 36 months meaning the club's overspend of the EFL's rules during that period was £20.8m above the £83m limit.

Although a maximum 12-point penalty could have been imposed, the committee worked down based on Leicester's percentage overspend and settled on six in light of the club's ""improving financial position"" over the assessment period.

'The aim for this season is now survival' - analysis

Jack Rafferty, BBC Radio Leicester matchday presenter

After years of speculation and legal battles, Leicester have finally been given the points deduction that has been looming for so long. 

Given there was rumours suggesting the punishment could hit double figures, six points does not seem too bad in the end.

For a club that has insisted it is fighting for promotion back to the Premier League, a deduction of that size should be an inconvenience, a minor disruption in terms of their goals in the Championship.

And yet, the Foxes now find themselves just outside of the relegation zone, currently surviving on goal difference alone.

Recent performances and results, including home defeats to Oxford and Charlton in the last two weeks, have been those of a team in freefall anyway, even without a six-point deduction. 

Fans have been saying for weeks that the club is at risk of relegation to League One, something that is now reflected by the Championship table.

The silver lining is that the uncertainty is over. The team, the board, the incoming manager (whoever that might end up being) know exactly what they need to do to stay in the second tier. 

Fans have wanted this saga to be over, no matter what the consequences, and the aim for this season is now clear - survival. 

Let's hope they are up for the fight.

Draper cruises to Davis Cup win on return from injury

By

Amy Lofthouse

BBC Sport senior journalist

Published

5 February 2026

Jack Draper says he is ""winning by being here"" as he made an emphatic return after a lengthy injury lay-off to help Great Britain take control of their Davis Cup qualifying tie against Norway.

British number one Draper has spent five months on the sidelines with a bruised bone in his service arm.

His comeback was delayed twice by the injury and he missed January's Australian Open to complete his recovery.

However, he served well, moved sharply and showed some brutal ball-striking to bear Viktor Durasovic 6-2 6-2 in his first competitive match for 164 days.

Sterner tests will await world number 13 Draper, who is ranked 300 places above Durasovic, but he will be relieved to have rattled through a convincing win after a long spell out.

""Tennis is a bubble, and sometimes you can get distracted that it's all that matters in life,"" the 24-year-old told BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller.

""When you have time out, I used it wisely I think to try and make sure that when I try and come back to tennis, that I'm ready to go all the way again.""

""I'm confident that I'm on a really good path. I'm winning by being here.""

Cameron Norrie then gave Britain a 2-0 lead with a characteristically gritty 6-4 6-4 win over teenager Nicolai Budkov Kjaer.

Lloyd Glasspool and Julian Cash can wrap up the best-of-five tie for Britain at the earliest opportunity if they triumph in Friday's doubles.

If not, Draper and Norrie will have to take to the court again for the reverse singles.

The winner of the tie in Oslo will face either Australia or Ecuador for a place in November's eight-team Finals.

Draper will be 'sensible' to manage injury

Jack Draper had not played competitively since the US Open first round on 25 August

Englishman Draper said he had ""lots of dark moments"" during the injury lay-off that disrupted his breakout season.

Draper had won the prestigious Masters 1,000 title at Indian Wells and reached the fourth round of the Australian and French Opens before being impacted by the injury in his left arm.

He suffered a second-round exit at Wimbledon and played just one match after before ending his season early.

There were very few signs of rust against Durasovic, with Draper dropping just 10 points on serve, hitting eight aces and winning 88% of first-serve points.

He produced three glorious passing shots - two off the backhand and one off the forehand - and moved well behind the baseline to suffocate Durasovic.

He went a quick break up in both sets and did not face a single break point.

Draper was only taken to deuce once, and that was when he served for the match at 5-2 up in the second. A thumping forehand and a long backhand from his opponent was enough to help the Briton wrap up victory in only 61 minutes.

""I definitely have to be wary of how the injury is progressing,"" Draper added.

""I wouldn't be back playing again if me and my team weren't really confident that I can start to build back on the tour again.

""I definitely have to be sensible at times.""

Norrie later came back from a 4-1 second-set deficit to see off world number 133 Budkov Kjaer.

Budkov Kjaer, a former Wimbledon junior champion, converted just one of his four break opportunities against Norrie.

'How much to play will be delicate balance for Draper'

By

Russell Fuller

Tennis correspondent in Oslo

Draper looked sharp on his return and there was little sign of rust in what turned out to be a very gentle stroll past Durasovic.

The 24-year-old had support from a vast travelling Lawn Tennis Association team as well as his new coach Jamie Delgado.

Personal coaches do not usually travel to Davis Cup ties, but this was the first chance Delgado has had to see Draper in action since succeeding James Trotman in the autumn.

Draper and Delgado are scheduled to head to Rotterdam after this tie for the British number one's return to the ATP Tour. 

How much to play, and how often to rest, will be a delicate balance to strike over the next few months.

Michael van Gerwen kick-started his bid for an eighth Premier League title in style with victory on night one of the 2026 tournament in Newcastle.

The Dutchman beat compatriot Gian van Veen 6-4 in the final to earn the £10,000 nightly prize and claim the first five points of the new season.

""It's definitely a good start - without even playing my A performance, I still won,"" he told Sky Sports.

""I think I was deadly. I had some fantastic finishing in the right moments.

""Whenever I had to perform on my own leg, I did it. That makes you win games.""

Van Veen impressed on debut and edged to a 6-4 quarter-final win over world number one Luke Littler - who beat him in the 2026 World Championship final.

He followed up that triumph with a 6-4 win in the semi-finals against 2021 champion Jonny Clayton - who had averaged 109.81 in defeating debutant Josh Rock 6-2 in the last eight.

But Van Veen came unstuck in a tight contest with Van Gerwen, who averaged seven points more than the European champion in the final to take victory.

It was a real boost for Van Gerwen, who failed to reach finals night last year for only the second time in 13 attempts.

The three-time world champion reeled off six consecutive legs to come from 2-0 down and beat Stephen Bunting 6-2 in the quarter-finals.

In the semi-finals, he earned another 6-2 win over reigning champion Luke Humphries - who had edged past Gerwyn Price 6-5 in a last-eight thriller.

Van Gerwen hit six of his seven attempts at double against Humphries before winning the all-Dutch final in the north-east of England.

Premier League Darts format and points system

Premier League Darts is played across 16 initial weeks in the league stage with quarter-finals, semi-finals and a final each night.

Each of the eight players is guaranteed to face the other seven in the quarter-finals in weeks one to seven and 9-15, with week eight and week 16 fixtures done off the table. It means we will get fourth v fifth in Sheffield on the final league-stage night, with the play-off spots potentially on the line.

Players earn two points per quarter-final win, an additional point if they win their semi-final and five for winning the night.

The top four players after the group stage progress to the play-off night at London's O2 Arena on 23 May, with first facing fourth and second against third in a best-of-19-leg match. The final, which is the best of 21 legs, follows.

If players are level on points after the 16 weeks then places are decided by nights won and then matches won.

Instead of simply viewing a film on a screen, VR allows you to feel like you’re part of the action. If you’re new to VR, watching your first VR movie can be an exciting but unfamiliar experience. In this guide, we’ll walk you through everything you need to know before jumping into your first VR movie.
<h3>What is a VR Movie?</h3>
A VR movie is different from a traditional movie. In a regular movie, you sit in front of a screen and watch the action unfold. In a VR movie, you wear a headset that lets you look around and experience the movie from different angles. It feels as if you’re inside the movie, surrounded by the scenes and characters. This creates a more immersive and interactive viewing experience, unlike anything you’ve tried before.
<h3>What You Need to Watch a VR Movie</h3>
Before you start, you’ll need a few things. First and most important is a <strong>VR headset</strong>. There are many options available, ranging from high-end devices like the Oculus Quest and PlayStation VR to more affordable options like Google Cardboard that work with your smartphone.

Here’s a simple list of what you’ll need:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>VR Headset</strong>: Choose one that fits your budget and device compatibility.</li>
 	<li><strong>Device</strong>: Depending on the headset, you may need a gaming console, PC, or smartphone.</li>
 	<li><strong>VR Movie App</strong>: To watch VR movies, you’ll need to download a VR movie player app or use a streaming service that supports VR content.</li>
 	<li><strong>Comfortable Space</strong>: You may want to sit or stand in a safe and comfortable space because VR requires head movement, and sometimes you may want to move around a bit to see different angles.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Setting Up Your VR Headset</h3>
The next step is setting up your <a href=""https://theimmersivetech.com/category/vr-headsets/"">VR headset</a>. Follow these basic steps to ensure everything is ready:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Unbox and Charge</strong>: Take your headset out of the box and charge it fully. Some headsets can be plugged into a computer or gaming console directly, while others, like the Oculus Quest, have their own power source.</li>
 	<li><strong>Fit the Headset</strong>: Adjust the straps on the headset to fit your head snugly. The headset should feel secure but not too tight. Make sure the lenses are centered for a clear view.</li>
 	<li><strong>Pair with Your Device</strong>: Connect the headset to your PC, gaming console, or smartphone, depending on the model. Most headsets come with a companion app to help with the setup process.</li>
 	<li><strong>Calibrate the Headset</strong>: Most VR systems will ask you to go through a setup or calibration process. This helps the system understand your position and movements so the movie appears correctly from your point of view.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Finding the Right VR Movie</h3>
Not all movies are made for VR, so it’s important to find the right content. You can find VR-specific movies on various platforms. Some popular ones include:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>YouTube VR</strong>: Offers a collection of 360-degree videos and VR movies.</li>
 	<li><strong>Oculus Store</strong>: If you own an Oculus device, there’s a variety of VR movies available for purchase or streaming.</li>
 	<li><strong>VeeR VR</strong>: A platform dedicated to VR content, including movies, documentaries, and short films.</li>
 	<li><strong>Netflix VR</strong>: While not all Netflix content is in VR, you can still watch movies in a virtual theater-like setting.</li>
</ul>
When choosing a movie, start with something short. VR movies can be intense, and long exposure can lead to motion sickness for beginners.
<h3>Watching Your First VR Movie</h3>
Now that everything is set up, it’s time to <a href=""https://theimmersivetech.com/how-to-watch-vr-movies/"">watch your first VR movie</a>. Here are a few tips to ensure the best experience:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Adjust the Focus</strong>: Make sure your headset is properly adjusted for focus. Some headsets come with knobs or sliders to change the lens distance, ensuring a clear picture.</li>
 	<li><strong>Get Comfortable</strong>: Sit or stand in a comfortable position before you begin. You’ll be wearing the headset for a while, so ensure that you’re not in a position that could strain your neck or back.</li>
 	<li><strong>Explore the Environment</strong>: In VR movies, you’re not limited to looking straight ahead. You can look up, down, and behind you. Take your time to explore the environment and fully immerse yourself in the experience.</li>
 	<li><strong>Pause if Needed</strong>: If you start feeling dizzy or uncomfortable, don’t hesitate to pause the movie. VR can sometimes overwhelm the senses, especially if you’re new to it. Take breaks as needed to avoid motion sickness.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Tips for Avoiding Motion Sickness</h3>
VR can be thrilling, but some people might experience motion sickness when they first start. Here are some tips to help you avoid it:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Take It Slow</strong>: Don’t watch long VR movies right away. Start with short clips to let your body adjust to the experience.</li>
 	<li><strong>Choose Stationary Content</strong>: For your first movie, opt for content where the camera doesn’t move much. Fast movements and shifts in perspective can increase the chances of motion sickness.</li>
 	<li><strong>Stay Hydrated</strong>: Drink water and take breaks if you feel uncomfortable.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
Your first VR movie experience can be exciting and memorable, but it’s important to ease into it. With the right headset, a good VR movie, and some patience, you’ll soon be enjoying an immersive movie-watching experience like never before. Remember to take breaks, find a comfortable spot, and most importantly, have fun!","",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,True,True,NULL

A <a href=""https://sidegigglobal.com/relieving-letter-format-free-samples-templates/"">Relieving Letter</a> is a crucial document issued by an employer to an employee upon their departure from the organization. It signifies that the employee has been officially relieved of their duties and responsibilities, thereby concluding their employment. This letter serves multiple purposes, both for the employee and the employer, and plays a significant role in the professional journey of an individual.

The primary function of a relieving letter is to confirm that the employee has completed their notice period and has left the organization on good terms. This document is essential for employees transitioning to new job opportunities, as it acts as proof of employment and ensures that they have fulfilled their obligations to the previous employer. In many cases, new employers require a relieving letter as part of the hiring process to verify an applicant's work history and ensure there are no outstanding issues with their former employment.

Moreover, a **relieving letter** often includes important details such as the employee's designation, the duration of their employment, and the reason for leaving the organization. By providing this information, the letter helps to maintain a professional record for the employee, which can be beneficial in future job searches. Employers typically include a statement of appreciation for the employee’s contributions to the organization, fostering a positive relationship even after the employment has ended.

From the employer's perspective, issuing a relieving letter is equally important. It helps formalize the separation process and mitigates any potential disputes regarding the employee's exit. By providing a well-drafted relieving letter, employers can safeguard their organization from any future claims or misunderstandings regarding the employee's tenure and conduct. Furthermore, it reflects the organization's professionalism and commitment to proper HR practices, which can enhance its reputation in the job market.

Another critical aspect of a **relieving letter** is that it often serves as a prerequisite for the final settlement of dues. Many companies have policies in place that require employees to submit their relieving letter to process their final paycheck, bonuses, or other financial settlements. This requirement emphasizes the importance of obtaining this document before leaving the organization.

When drafting a relieving letter, there are several key elements that should be included. The letter should be on official company letterhead and include the date of issuance. It should clearly state the employee's name, designation, and the duration of their employment. A concise statement confirming the completion of the notice period and relieving the employee from their responsibilities should follow. Lastly, a note expressing gratitude for the employee's contributions can leave a positive impression and encourage goodwill.

In conclusion, a **relieving letter** is a vital document that plays a significant role in the professional lives of employees. It serves as an official confirmation of their departure from the organization and is essential for securing future employment opportunities. Both employees and employers benefit from the proper issuance and receipt of a relieving letter, as it helps to ensure smooth transitions and maintains professional relationships. As such, understanding the importance of this document can greatly impact an individual's career trajectory and the organization's reputation in the job market.

Ensuring that you obtain a relieving letter upon your departure from a company is crucial. It not only validates your employment history but also serves as a testament to your professional conduct.

<p class="""" data-start=""350"" data-end=""843"">In today's fast-paced and digital-first business environment, entrepreneurs and startups are constantly looking for cost-effective ways to expand their presence across multiple states. One such solution that has gained immense popularity is the use of a <strong data-start=""604"" data-end=""643"">virtual office for GST registration</strong>. This concept is not only legally accepted but also offers numerous practical benefits for businesses aiming to comply with state-specific GST laws without setting up a physical office in each state.</p>

<h3 class="""" data-start=""845"" data-end=""874"">What is a Virtual Office?</h3>
<p class="""" data-start=""876"" data-end=""1236"">A virtual office is a service that provides businesses with a professional business address, mail handling, and sometimes additional facilities like access to meeting rooms, without the need to maintain a physical office. For regulatory purposes, such as obtaining a GST number in a specific state, this address can be used as your principal place of business.</p>

<h3 class="""" data-start=""1238"" data-end=""1295"">Legal Validity of Virtual Office for GST Registration</h3>
<p class="""" data-start=""1297"" data-end=""1758"">According to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) Act and associated rules, a taxpayer must declare a <strong data-start=""1395"" data-end=""1433"">Principal Place of Business (PPOB)</strong> at the time of GST registration. This is the location where the business’s core activities are carried out or where the records are maintained. The law does not mandate owning or leasing a full-scale physical workspace. Therefore, using a virtual office—when properly documented—is fully legal for GST registration purposes.</p>
<p class="""" data-start=""1760"" data-end=""1831"">However, the virtual office must provide genuine documentation such as:</p>

<ul data-start=""1833"" data-end=""1984"">
 	<li class="""" data-start=""1833"" data-end=""1869"">
<p class="""" data-start=""1835"" data-end=""1869"">Agreement for virtual office usage</p>
</li>
 	<li class="""" data-start=""1870"" data-end=""1926"">
<p class="""" data-start=""1872"" data-end=""1926"">No Objection Certificate (NOC) from the property owner</p>

<h3 class="""" data-start=""1986"" data-end=""2045"">When Do You Need a Virtual Office for GST Registration?</h3>
<p class="""" data-start=""2047"" data-end=""2118"">A virtual office is particularly beneficial in the following scenarios:</p>

But what sets it apart from a regular modular kitchen is the attention to premium materials, smart design, and flawless finishes.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400"">Think of sleek Italian cabinetry, high-gloss acrylic finishes, handleless drawers, ambient lighting, and integrated appliances—all working together to create a kitchen that’s functional and fabulous.</span>
<h3><b>Why Choose a Luxury Modular Kitchen in 2025?</b></h3>
<h4><b>1. Modern Aesthetics with Timeless Elegance</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400"">2025 is all about mixing cutting-edge design with comfort. A luxury modular kitchen brings in elements like muted color palettes, marble countertops, hidden storage, and matte-finish cabinets. These are not only stylish but also age gracefully—so your kitchen always looks on-trend.</span>
<h4><b>2. Smart Storage for Everyday Convenience</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400"">Gone are the days of cluttered countertops and overstuffed cabinets. With innovative storage like magic corners, tall units, pull-out drawers, and cutlery organizers, everything has a place. Your luxury kitchen should feel open, breathable, and easy to work in.</span>
<h4><b>3. Integrated Appliances for a Seamless Look</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400"">A true </span><b>luxury modular kitchen</b><span style=""font-weight: 400""> integrates appliances into the design. Think built-in ovens, smart dishwashers, touch-controlled hobs, and sensor-based lighting—all contributing to a seamless, high-tech kitchen experience.</span>
<h4><b>4. Personalized Layouts That Fit Your Lifestyle</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400"">Whether you’re a gourmet chef or a weekend cook, your kitchen layout matters. In 2025, personalization is key. With </span><b>Ideal Modular Kitchen</b><span style=""font-weight: 400"">, you can design a U-shaped, L-shaped, parallel, or island kitchen that matches your cooking habits and maximizes your space.</span>
<h3><b>Top Luxury Modular Kitchen Trends in 2025</b></h3>
<h4><b>1. Minimalist Design with Maximum Impact</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400"">Clean lines, neutral tones, and clutter-free countertops dominate this year’s luxury kitchen look. Handleless cabinets, flat-panel doors, and push-to-open drawers are on-trend, creating a sleek, sophisticated space.</span>
<h4><b>2. Natural Materials and Textures</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400"">Wooden laminates, stone countertops, and textured backsplashes are making a comeback. They bring warmth and organic charm to an otherwise modern setup. Ideal Modular Kitchen offers a wide range of premium textures and materials to choose from.</span>
<h4><b>3. Ambient Lighting and Under-Cabinet LEDs</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400"">Lighting sets the mood. In luxury kitchens, you’ll find warm under-cabinet lighting, pendant lights over the island, and sensor-activated drawer lights that add elegance and improve visibility.</span>
<h4><b>4. Touch-Free Technology</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400"">Touchless taps, motion sensor lights, and voice-activated appliances are now standard in many </span><b>luxury modular kitchen</b><span style=""font-weight: 400""> setups. It’s all about convenience, hygiene, and futuristic appeal.</span>
<h4><b>5. Bold Color Accents</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400"">While neutral tones dominate, bold colors like navy blue, forest green, and matte black are being used as accent shades in cabinets, backsplashes, or even kitchen islands for a stunning visual contrast.</span>
<h3><b>Luxury Modular Kitchen Layouts That Work</b></h3>
<h4><b>U-Shaped Luxury Modular Kitchen</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400"">Perfect for large homes and avid cooks, the </span><a href=""https://www.idealmodularkitchen.com/u-shaped-kitchen.php""><b>U-shaped layout</b></a><span style=""font-weight: 400""> offers ample counter space, multiple work zones, and great storage.

<h4><b>Island Kitchen Design</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400"">The island is the crown jewel of any </span><b>luxury modular kitchen</b><span style=""font-weight: 400"">. Use it as a prep station, breakfast bar, or even a wine storage area. It adds elegance and utility at the same time.</span>
<h4><b>Parallel or Galley Kitchen</b></h4>

In India, that fiery flavor comes at a fiery price. While a bag of Cheetos might cost a dollar or two in other parts of the world, here in India, you're looking at a significantly steeper price tag. But why the shocking difference? Let's dive into the reasons behind the high cost of Cheetos in India.</p>
<p data-sourcepos=""5:1-5:125""><strong>1. Import Fees and Taxes:</strong> Cheetos isn't manufactured in India. They're imported, which means they incur import duties and taxes. These additional costs get factored into the final price you see on the shelf.</p>
<p data-sourcepos=""7:1-7:198""><strong>2. Lower Production Volume:</strong> Compared to countries where Cheetos are a staple, the demand in India is lower. This lower production volume for the Indian market can lead to higher per-unit costs.</p>
<p data-sourcepos=""9:1-9:254""><strong>3. Limited Distribution Channels:</strong> Finding Cheetos in every Indian store might be a challenge. Since they're a niche imported product, they might only be available in specific supermarkets or online retailers, potentially adding markups to the price.</p>
<p data-sourcepos=""11:1-11:82""><strong>4. Brand Image as an Imported Good:</strong> Sometimes, imported goods are perceived as being of higher quality or more exclusive. This brand image can influence the pricing strategy, making them pricier than locally produced snacks.</p>
<p data-sourcepos=""13:1-13:40""><strong>Alternatives to Keep the Spice Alive</strong></p>
<p data-sourcepos=""15:1-15:107"">While the hefty price tag of Cheetos might leave you wanting, there are some fiery alternatives to explore:</p>

<ul data-sourcepos=""17:1-20:0"">
 	<li data-sourcepos=""17:1-17:137""><strong>Kurkure:</strong> This Indian snack brand offers a range of flavors, including some with a spicy kick that can satisfy your Cheetos craving.</li>
 	<li data-sourcepos=""18:1-18:120""><strong>Bingo!:</strong> Another popular Indian brand with exciting flavors, some with a spicy twist, to tantalize your taste buds.</li>
 	<li data-sourcepos=""19:1-20:0""><strong>Local Spicy Snacks:</strong> Don't underestimate the local snacks! Many regional specialties offer a burst of spice and flavor at a fraction of the cost of imported brands.</li>
</ul>
<p data-sourcepos=""21:1-21:207""><strong>So, the next time you have a craving for a cheesy, spicy snack, consider these factors behind the high price of Cheetos in India and explore the many delicious and budget-friendly alternatives available!</strong></p>

<p>The Supreme Cheetah is a sweet Doritos chip. They are made from vegetable oil, corn, buttermilk, natural and artificial flavors, lactic acid, lactose, yellow sugar, green bell pepper, garlic powder, tomato powder, cheese cultures, Romano cheese, onion powder, sodium caseinate, corn starch, and dextrose. This flavor is not amongst the best, but it is nice to consume.</p>

<p>These suckers have far less flavor, as well as the delicacy is the star of the show. It's similar to Asian pepper sauce, but a lot milder. More dangerously, that is one of the few times when the absence of cheese is appreciated. As a result, it is a commendable Doritos Flavor to grab at your eternal need.<em>Purple bag Doritos</em> are the tastiest bangingest sweet salty woods euphoria on a tortilla chip anywhere. </p>

<p>The spice is light and fluffy, and it transforms ordinary salad dressing into a delicious coating for tortilla chips. The chips have a more synthetic flavor, but they pack a powerful flavor bite. The one and only concern we can see is that if you eat too many, they can turn milky. That isn't great! It is not the best choice for the long run.</p>

<!-- wp:paragraph -->
<p>This same salsa Verde flavor is really not exceptionally hot, but each bite has a distinct punch at the climax. These chips have a strong flavor profile. They could be the most powerful of the other Doritos flavors I evaluated. Salsa Verde is the choice I will tell any lover of Doritos to take and feel.</p>

<p>This Doritos flavor is the people’s choice. It has a pepper flavor, but it is sweeter in terms of choice. It is almost the same with Romano and Cheddar. The best part is that you can always unwrap crackers next to a crowd of chipotle pepper people and guarantee yourself the entire packet. When you're just being a selfish child, you will appear to become a very stubborn person.</p>

<h4><strong>Data Sources - Power BI Vs. Tableau</strong></h4>
<p>In comparison to Tableau, Power BI offers a variety of data sources but has restricted access to other databases and servers. Examples are MS Excel, Folders, MS SQL Server, IBM DB2, Access DB, Text/CSV, Oracle Database, etc.</p>
<p>Tableau Software offers access to various data sources and servers, including Excel, Text PDF, Dropbox, JSON, File, statistical files, Cloudera Hadoop, Google Analytics, Amazon Redshift, Google Drive, and Google Sheets.</p>
<h4><strong>Data Visualization - Power BI Vs. Tableau </strong></h4>
<p>Both Power BI and Tableau tools follow different techniques of visualizing the data. While Power BI focuses on manipulating, reporting, and predictive modeling data, Tableau aims to visualize the data in a simplified form so that analysts can prepare a report by comparing, analyzing, and adjusting the data accordingly. Power BI is more like a manipulating data tool than a visualization tool. You can access visualizations easily in Tableau, and it is more likely a query-based tool.</p>
<h4><strong>Power BI vs. Tableau Cost Comparison</strong></h4>
<p>Power BI tool is affordable compared to Tableau, and it is cost-effective and efficient for corporate users, particularly those who are already familiar with Microsoft products. In contrast to Tableau, Power BI is a low-cost BI solution, even if we choose a monthly subscription or scaled premium service. However, the cost is subjective and depends on the number of users, scalability, and upkeep. </p>
<p>Tableau is relatively expensive, based on the principle that the more you pay, the more you can access. Tableau's data visualization, data interpretation, and connection with scripting languages like R and Python make it a favourite among data analysts, regardless of price.</p>
<h4><strong>Scope of Learning Power Bi and Tableau</strong></h4>
<p>Business intelligence and data visualization are two fields with promising career prospects in today's data-driven world. As data visualization is the future of business, Power BI and Tableau will be essential learning tools for ambitious candidates.</p>
<p>When it comes to job opportunities, Data scientists, Product Managers, Software Engineers, Business Intelligence Developers, and Business Analysts are just a few of the jobs available with Microsoft Power BI. Tableau offers a choice of career categories to pick such as Tableau Consultant, Data Analyst, Business Analyst, Business Intelligence Analyst and Business Intelligence Developer are some of the most popular job titles for Tableau Professionals.</p>
<h4><strong>Conclusion</strong></h4>
<p>So, here are some of the differences stated between Power BI and Tableau tools. Both the tools have equal demands in the job market. You can get better job opportunities after learning any of the tools, and you can choose one according to your interest and preferences.</p>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">In fact, the very first <a href=""https://www.learninsider.com/the-best-flavors-of-the-doritos-chips/"">Doritos flavor</a> was Taco. They were released in 1966 and quickly became a hit. People loved the crispy texture and the zesty flavor.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It wasn't long before other flavors were added to the lineup, including Nacho Cheese, Cool Ranch, and Spicy Nacho. And today, Doritos are available in over 20 different flavors worldwide.</span>
<h2><b>Doritos Are Made From Corn, Not Potatoes</b></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Who would have thought that Doritos were made from corn and not potatoes? Well, it's true! Doritos are actually made from cornmeal-based dough that's then fried and shaped into those iconic triangle chips.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But here's the kicker: the chips are then flavored with all kinds of spices and seasonings, giving them their unique taste. Some popular flavors include Nacho Cheese, Cool Ranch, and Fiery Habanero.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So the next time you're munching on a bag of Doritos, you can impress your friends with your knowledge of chip trivia!</span>
<h2><b>The Original Doritos Were Green, Not Orange</b></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Doritos have been around for a long time—since 1966, to be exact. And back in the day, they were a different color. Yep, that's right. The original Doritos were green, not orange. They were also thicker and puffier than the chips we know and love today.</span>
<h2><b>There Are Over 30 Flavors of Doritos</b></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Have you ever wondered how many different flavors of Doritos there are? (We're guessing the answer is no, but we'll tell you anyway). There are over 30 different flavors of <a href=""https://snackstar.in/collections/doritos"">Fdip</a>, and they come in all sorts of crazy varieties.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">There's the Cool Ranch flavor, the <a href=""https://snackstar.in/products/jacobs-mini-cheddars-nacho-cheese-jalapeno-90g?_pos=1&amp;_sid=1505dc2c9&amp;_ss=r"">Nacho Cheese flavor</a>, the Fiery Habanero flavor, and so many more. There's probably a flavor for every palate out there. So if you're looking to change up your snacking routine, we suggest giving Doritos a try. You won't be disappointed.</span>
<h2><b>You Can Make Your Own Doritos at Home</b></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Here's a fun fact for you: did you know that you can actually make your own Doritos at home? It's true!</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">All you need is some corn tortillas, oil, and spices. You can customize the flavors however you want, and it's a great way to get that crispy Doritos texture without going to the store.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So why not give it a try? It's a fun project to do with friends, and the result is something everyone can enjoy.</span>
<h2><b>There Is a 'Doritos for Breakfast' Cereal</b></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You probably know that Doritos are a popular tortilla chip brand, but you might not know that they also have breakfast cereal! It's called Doritos for Breakfast. It's a corn-flakes style cereal that comes in three flavors: cheese, bacon, and ranch.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The best part is that it's vegan-friendly. If you're looking for a fun and unique breakfast option, give Doritos for Breakfast a try!</span>

This article will let you know what things to consider before buying electric scooters in India. This will help you differentiate India's best electric scooter from the average.</span>
<h3><b>First and foremost. What's your purpose for buying electric scooters in India?</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Currently available electric scooters can be divided into two groups based on their intended usage: commercial and personal. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Storage capacity and load-carrying ability are often the two primary considerations for commercial electric scooters. These versions are built inexpensively and are utilized for delivery in the B2B market. These low-speed types of professionally utilized electric scooters have the barest features.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Now for personal use, how much is your daily commute? You can choose a low-speed electric scooter if it's less than 30 km daily. But if your daily commute is more than 30 km daily, then you can choose the high-speed electric scooter.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Vegh Automobiles have both options for you. Vegh S25 and Vegh L25 are low-speed electric scooters, while Vegh S60 (coming soon) is a high-speed electric scooter.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Although the low-speed variants are far less expensive, they can be used inside cities, have the most basic capabilities, and require no operating license. On the other hand, high-speed electric two-wheelers belong to the premium category.</span>
<h3><b>What are the range and speed of the electric scooter you are looking for?</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The minimum range for electric two-wheelers for daily commuting should be between 70-90 kilometers. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It doesn't matter whether it's a low-speed or high-speed electric scooter. The range is the key. The higher the range, the better the electric scooter.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With a low-range electric scooter, you have to charge it repeatedly. The best electric scooters in India are those with more than 70 kilometers per charge range.</span>
<h3><b>Charging Convenience </b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Electric scooter manufacturer provides you <strong><a href=""https://thevegh.com/product/vegh-l-25/"">electric scooters</a></strong> with a charger that you can use almost anywhere and everywhere. With these chargers, the need for an appropriate parking spot to charge scooters with fixed batteries can be a hassle if your home or office needs a charger or a charging plug in the parking area. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Manufacturers also offer batteries in swappable, removable, and fixed versions. On a subscription basis, riders can swap the depleted battery for a charged one. While portable batteries can be charged at home, work, or even in a parking lot, they are difficult to transport. </span>
<h4><b>What is the electric scooter's price in India, and how much subsidy can you get?</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The price of an EV can range from Rs 50,000 to Rs 1.5 lakh, depending on its intended use.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The FAME II and State subsidies are included in the aforementioned asking prices (select states only). Notably, the FAME II subsidy for 10 lakh electric two-wheelers would only be available until March 2024. You might anticipate an increase in EV pricing after the expiration of the FAME II.</span>
<h4><b>What's the after-sale service you are getting from your dealer/manufacturer?</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Since the main consumables for EVs are brake pads and tires, after-sales services are minimal. You'll also need to change the battery and service the motor after a particular amount of miles on the odometer or a predetermined period (if needed). Therefore, we advise you to thoroughly research the service facilities and the periods at which the e-scooter or bike needs a checkup.</span>","what-to-consider-before-buying-electric-scooters-in-india",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,True,True,NULL

<b>Increase Profits</b>

But no matter what you call your snack food, it's important to know where it comes from and whether the ingredients are sustainable.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">But first, let's talk about what mold is and why it's a problem. Basically, mold is a type of fungus that grows in damp and humid conditions and can be found indoors and outdoors. While some types of mold are harmless, others can cause health problems and structural damage to your property.</span>

<h2><b>The Mold Remediation Process Typically Involves the Following Steps:</b></h2>
<h4><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">​</span><b>Step 1: ​Identify the source of the moisture</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Mold thrives in damp environments, so the first step is to identify the moisture source causing mold growth. This includes anything from a leaky roof to a burst pipe, so inspecting your property thoroughly is important.</span>
<h4><b>Step 2: Contain the mold</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Once the source of the moisture has been identified, the next step is to contain the mold to prevent it from spreading to other areas of your property. It typically involves using plastic sheeting and tape to seal off the affected area.</span>
<h4><b>Step 3: Remove the mold</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">This is where the real work begins. Depending on the extent of the mold growth, we may need to use specialized cleaning products or physically remove the affected materials. And yes, it's as messy and unpleasant as it sounds.</span>
<h4><b>Step 4: Dry the affected area </b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Once the mold has been removed, we need to make sure the affected area is thoroughly dried to prevent future mold growth. This may involve using dehumidifiers, fans, or other drying equipment.</span>
<h4><b>Step 5: Repair any damage</b></h4>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If the mold has caused any structural damage to your property, we need to fix it as soon as possible to prevent further problems. This could involve replacing warped floorboards or repairing damaged drywall.</span>

The buttermilk used in Doritos is okay if compliant with dairy product rules.

<h2>Certainly! Here's a brief description of local home shifting tips and a checklist to help you with your move:</h2>
<strong>Local Home Shifting Tips &amp; Checklist</strong>

Moving to a new home within the same locality or city requires careful planning and organization. Here are some essential tips and a checklist to make your local home shifting process smoother and more efficient:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Plan Ahead:</strong> Start planning your move well in advance to avoid last-minute stress and chaos. Create a timeline and allocate specific tasks for each day leading up to the move.</li>
 	<li><strong>Declutter:</strong> Before you start packing, take the opportunity to declutter your belongings. Sort through each room and get rid of items you no longer need or use. Donate, sell, or discard them responsibly.</li>
 	<li><strong>Pack Room by Room:</strong> To stay organized, pack one room at a time. This approach makes unpacking easier and minimizes confusion during the relocation process.</li>
 	<li><strong>Obtain Packing Supplies:</strong> Gather all the necessary packing supplies such as cardboard boxes, bubble wrap, packing tape, markers, and labels. Ensure you have an ample supply of these materials to avoid running out during the packing process.</li>
 	<li><strong>Label and Categorize Boxes:</strong> Clearly label each box with the name of the room it belongs to and a brief description of its contents. This labeling system helps movers and makes unpacking more efficient. Additionally, categorize boxes by priority, marking those containing essential items as ""Open First.""</li>
 	<li><strong>Protect Fragile Items:</strong> Use bubble wrap, packing paper, or towels to protect fragile items during transit. Wrap delicate items individually and label the boxes as ""Fragile"" to ensure proper handling.</li>
 	<li><strong>Take Inventory:</strong> Make a detailed inventory list of all your belongings. This will help you keep track of your items during the move and ensure that nothing is lost or left behind.</li>
 	<li><strong>Notify Service Providers:</strong> Inform your utility companies, internet service provider, post office, and other relevant parties about your change of address. Schedule disconnections, transfers, or new installations as needed.</li>
 	<li><strong>Transfer or Update Subscriptions:</strong> Transfer or cancel subscriptions for newspapers, magazines, and other regular deliveries. Update your address for online shopping accounts, subscription boxes, and any other services that require your current address.</li>
 	<li><strong>Update Important Documents:</strong> Notify your bank, insurance provider, and other financial institutions about your change of address. Update your driver's license, vehicle registration, and voter registration accordingly.</li>
 	<li><strong>Hire Professional Movers:</strong> If you decide to hire professional movers, research and book a reputable local moving company well in advance. Obtain multiple quotes, compare their services and reviews, and ensure they are licensed and insured.</li>
 	<li><strong>Measure Furniture and Doorways:</strong> Measure your furniture and doorways in both your current and new home to ensure a smooth transition. This step will help you determine if any items need disassembly or if they won't fit through certain doorways.</li>
 	<li><strong>Pack Essentials Separately:</strong> Pack a separate bag or box with essential items you'll need immediately upon arrival at your new home. This may include toiletries, a change of clothes, medications, important documents, and basic kitchen supplies.</li>
 	<li><strong>Arrange for Transport:</strong> If you are moving on your own, arrange for a suitable mode of transport such as a rental truck or van. Ensure that you have the necessary driving license and permits if required.</li>
 	<li><strong>Seek Help:</strong> Enlist the help of friends or family members to assist with the packing, loading, and unloading process. Having an extra set of hands can make the moving process faster and more efficient.</li>
 	<li><strong>Take Care of Valuables:</strong> Keep important documents, jewelry, and other valuables with you during the move. Transport them separately to ensure their safety and security.</li>
 	<li><strong>Clean and Prepare the New Home:</strong> Before moving into your new home, ensure that it</li>

These infections can be uncomfortable and unsightly, causing itching, burning, and cracking symptoms. If left untreated, they can even lead to serious complications. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Thankfully, there are medications available that effectively treat fungal skin infections. Among them is Funout Powder – an antifungal dusting powder specially designed to combat these types of skin infections. So let's explore why Funout Powder is the right choice for your </span>fungal infection treatment<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">. </span>
<h2><b>Potent Antifungal Properties</b></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Funout Powder is formulated with potent antifungal drugs that inhibit the growth of fungi responsible for various dermatophyte-related diseases like athlete's foot (tinea pedis), ringworm (tinea corporis), jock itch (tinea cruris), etc.  </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The primary active ingredient in Funout Powder is Clotrimazole - a highly effective medication used widely across India in different topical preparations for treating fungal skin diseases. It stops the replication and spread of fungi by targeting their cell membrane. It makes it an ideal solution for those who suffer from persistent or recurring fungal skin problems and needs </span><a href=""https://cosmocutis.com/products/funout-powder/""><b>fungal infection treatment</b></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Funout Powder not only cures but also helps to relieve symptoms associated with most common superficial mycoses like itching sensation, redness &amp; scaling, etc., providing instant relief from discomfort caused due to them.  </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">It contains carefully selected ingredients and Clotrimazole that help soothe irritated skin while simultaneously promoting healing. It helps your body restore health naturally during the ongoing treatment process itself!</span>
<h2><b>Controls Excessive Sweating That Worsens Fungal Infection</b></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Excessive sweating is one factor that contributes significantly to the worsening or recurrence of fungal infections repeatedly over time. We might often see a cure apparent after taking antifungals, but within months, our condition may worsen again! This happens when we don't control excessive sweating, which provides an ideal environment for fungi to grow and spread further. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Funout Powder helps prevent this by controlling excess sweat and keeping your skin dry &amp; comfortable. The powder's unique formula is a natural deodorant that keeps you fresh while protecting against fungal infections!</span>
<h2><b>Easy-to-Use Topical Application</b></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the best things about Funout Powder is its user-friendly application process. You can simply sprinkle some powder on the affected area or take it in cotton buds form before applying it over infected parts locally on affected areas only! Make sure to follow adequate hygiene protocols during &amp; between your usages for optimal infection recovery recommendations. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The product packaging includes detailed instructions that walk you through how much to apply and when, so there's no need to worry about getting it wrong. It applies quickly and effectively, helping you regain control faster than ever! </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">If you're dealing with fungal skin, consider trying Funout Powder! It offers powerful antifungal properties and relief from itching and burning sensations while controlling excessive. </span><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">So why not give it a try today to this best </span>fungal infection treatment?<span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Order Funout Powder online at <a href=""https://cosmocutis.com/""><strong>Cosmocutis.com</strong></a> at affordable prices with fast shipping anywhere across India nationwide!</span>","try-this-best-powder-for-fungal-infection-treatment",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,True,True,NULL

Paid advertising is a terrific method to acquire instant awareness and highly targeted traffic, but it's also important to work on your long-term organic visibility. The problem is that search engine optimization (SEO) is a time-consuming marketing strategy that requires consistent effort. And thus lies the problem. Because they are local businesses, they are not utilizing one of the most important and effective marketing methods for local businesses. Woof. You don't have time to conduct SEO, and you also don't have time to learn enough about it to employ the best small company SEO services.

That is precisely why I wrote this piece. I'd like to change that for you, so here's what we'll talk about:
<ul>
 	<li>The fundamentals of SEO and why it is critical for local companies.</li>
 	<li>The advantages of using small company SEO services.</li>
 	<li>Where to get low-cost local SEO services</li>
 	<li>What features should an SEO service provider have?</li>
</ul>
Search engines are where your clients are, and it is there that you must differentiate yourself from competition. So let's get you ready for it.
<h2>What is small business SEO?</h2>
Before we go into the services that an SEO business provides, let's make sure you know what SEO is. Many business owners consider search engine optimization (SEO) to be a mystery that can only be solved by those with insider knowledge. Yes, an SEO service business will have inside information that you do not, but knowing the fundamentals is essential, and they can be broken down into simple concepts:

Even if you optimize for search engines, search engines base their ranking algorithms on user behaviour in order to be the most trustworthy source of information available. This means that, at the end of the day, you're actually just optimizing for search engine users, or individuals who are similar to you.

SEO is a set of initiatives that work together to assist search engines like Google find your business website, recognize it as trustworthy, organize the material you publish on it, and Show it to those who are looking for it.
<h3><strong>Search</strong></h3>
A search engine is one of the most frequent ways for people to find products, services, and businesses near them (hence the phrase ""local search"").  They will use Google to enter a search term or inquiry (also known as a keyword). Google will then return the results it has determined to be the most relevant and informative, including local results whenever possible.

In fact, the local results frequently fill up the entire initial view. When I type ""camera repair shop"" into Google without specifying my location, this is what I get:
<h3><strong>Engine</strong></h3>
Search engines (such as Google) that we use to discover information employ complex algorithms (or formulae) to detect, analyse, and prioritize content. The engine's ""spiders"" crawl the web constantly, screening every page they come across with this formula and storing the findings in a database (called their index). When a user conducts a search, Google retrieves results from its index rather than from the actual internet.

The main thing to remember about SEO is that it is all about communicating the quality of your website pages and their relevance to specific locations and terms in a language that a computer can comprehend, such as through meta tags.
<h3><strong>Optimization</strong></h3>
To be found by potential consumers via a Google search, you must rank high on Google, preferably on the first page and in the top few results as a result, your material must be optimized for search engines. Thus, ""search engine optimization.""

And it is in the optimization phase that a small company SEO service comes into action. SEO produces significant and long-term results, but only when done correctly. As a small firm or solopreneur, it might be challenging to implement all of the optimizations correctly, much alone figure out what those methods are to begin with. So, let's talk about SEO marketing services.
<h2>Why hire an SEO services company?</h2>
<img class=""alignright wp-image-4130"" src=""https://www.learninsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/hand-arrange-white-letters-as-seo-1024x683.jpg"" alt=""SEO Freelancer services"" width=""378"" height=""252"" />

So, as I've just proved, search is a very localized phenomenon, and it's for this reason that it's a useful small-company marketing strategy. But why should you choose an <a href=""https://seofreelancergurgaon.com/search-engine-optimization""><strong>SEO service provider</strong></a>?
<h3><strong>SEO is complex</strong></h3>
Even though I have condensed SEO into its fundamental components above, it is not any less complex. Small business SEO is just as vital as big business SEO. SEO, as previously said, is a set of methods that work together to boost exposure on local search engine results pages. You may be able to do the fundamentals of SEO, but if you can't execute all of the approaches, your efforts may fall flat and your time will be squandered.
<h3><strong>SEO requires ongoing work</strong></h3>
SEO is not a one-time marketing tactic. There are certain one-time adjustments that require little to no upkeep, but true SEO is a never-ending job in progress. It entails:
<ul>
 	<li>Regularly publishing new, high-quality information.</li>
 	<li>Constantly updating current pages for correctness.</li>
 	<li>Going back into old pages and adding connections to new pages.</li>
 	<li>Promoting content through other channels such as social media and email.</li>
</ul>
Many small business owners have plenty on their plates just running their daily operations. Your website may generate traffic and leads for you in the background with the help of an SEO services provider, leaving you to focus on your clients.
<h3><strong>SEO is a moving target</strong></h3>
As we covered in the ""engine"" section of our SEO intro above, Google uses a sophisticated algorithm that considers various ranking indications to determine the quality, relevancy, and accuracy of a website. Many of the ranking criteria are known to us, but not all of them. Furthermore, Google's algorithm is always evolving. A small business SEO firm can keep up with algorithm modifications and adjust the strategy as needed.
<h3><strong>Knowledge and tools</strong></h3>
Free keyword tools are excellent for use while developing content and performing SEO tasks. SEO tools and service subscriptions can also be beneficial, but you must first learn how to use each platform properly. A professional SEO service provider has both the greatest tools and skills, which when combined can provide you an advantage over your competitors.
<h2>Benefits of using a website SEO service</h2>
So we've seen how much time and work an SEO partner can save from your small business marketing to-do list, but now let's talk about what you get in return.
<h3><strong>Stay focused on growth</strong></h3>
As previously said, SEO requires a significant amount of time—not only for each particular strategy, but also for continuing maintenance and staying on top of Google's updates. You no longer have to dive down the rabbit hole of meta tag how-tos, SEO audits (unless you want to) and Google upgrades by employing a website SEO service provider. This gives you more time to concentrate on other parts of your business, such as expanding your offerings or clientele.
<h3><strong>See quick (er) success</strong></h3>
SEO initiatives can take weeks or even months to pay off in terms of increased website traffic and customers. So, while I believe that learning the hard way is typically the best way, SEO's high turnaround time makes it unappealing for trial and error. A small company SEO service's specialists have the combined years of expertise to swiftly uncover victories and errors that would otherwise take you years (and precious brain cells) to achieve on your own. Plus, I'm sure you're already learning the hard way about a slew of other parts of your business.
<h3><strong>Understand your data</strong></h3>
The faster you can increase your website traffic; the more valuable data you will have to work with. But what data is useful? What are you expected to do with all of this? Another advantage of employing a small business SEO service. They can analyze your website traffic and extract vital insights to help you achieve your small business objectives. They can assist you in seeing:
<ul>
 	<li>Which pages receive the most traffic?</li>
 	<li>Which calls to action are the most effective?</li>
 	<li>Which landing pages convert the best?</li>
 	<li>Your target audience's demographic profile.</li>
</ul>
These insights will inform your future content strategy and assist your SEO provider in narrowing down its efforts to only those that are worth your money.
<h3><strong>Activate your marketing flywheel</strong></h3>
Starting with SEO can be challenging, but powerful SEO methods performed by a trustworthy SEO company eventually create a self-perpetuating loop. More visitors will reach your pages in search results as your website rank rises. You will rank better if more people come and remain on your pages. More sites will link to your pages if they have a high rank and are exposed to your high-value content. This boosts your domain authority and reliability, which helps your website rank even higher. And so forth. And the higher you rank on Google, the more successfully you will reach your target demographic.
<h3><strong>Generate more sales</strong></h3>
When SEO is done correctly, you will see not only more visitors to your website, but also more quality visitors. Because search engines deliver results to users who are actively searching for a specific term or phrase, reaching the top of the stack means you're providing information to the people who need it the most, when they need it. This means that users who find your site through a search engine are more likely to convert.
<h2>What will an Our SEO services do?</h2>
If you understand the fundamentals of SEO, yet are considering employing an <a href=""https://seofreelancergurgaon.com/search-engine-optimization""><strong>SEO services company</strong></a> for your company, you may be wondering what they will accomplish. In this section, we'll delve a little deeper into their strategies so you may develop a more realistic mental picture and understand phrases that may come up in your chat with an SEO service provider.
<h3><strong>On-page SEO</strong></h3>
An SEO services company's on-page activities are focused on the ""crawlability"" and usability of your website's pages. They will optimize the elements of your website that are visible to the public and read by search engines. This comprises

<strong>Content:</strong> They'll ensure that the material on your pages is relevant to the keywords you're attempting to rank for, as well as valuable and high-quality.

<strong>Experience:</strong> They'll employ website analytics to determine how engaging a page is and make recommendations for improving the user experience.

<strong>Structure:</strong> They will ensure that your website's linking hierarchy is ordered and easy for search engines to explore.

<strong>Metadata:</strong> They will ensure that each page has title tags, headers, image tags, and meta descriptions that contain the required keywords.
<h3><strong>Off-page SEO</strong></h3>

<strong>Site performance:</strong> includes page load speed, responsiveness (how well the site renders and performs on any device or screen size), and picture size.

<strong>Backlinks:</strong> They will assist you in obtaining links to your site from other reputable websites.

<strong>Domain authority:</strong> They will ensure that you are continually gaining trust with Google.

How to Choosing an SEO Service Provider for Your Small Business?

It can be challenging to begin your search for the best SEO agency. We've developed a short list of critical considerations to help you navigate the hundreds of organizations that all claim to be the ""best.""
<h3><strong>1. Look beyond the #1 ranked agency</strong></h3>
Sure, you may argue that they must know what they're doing because they've made it to the top, but by doing so, you risk overlooking other high performers who may be smaller and more personal to work with, and even closer to you geographically. Many SEO service providers are actually great at what they do, and instead of focusing on ranking for highly competitive keywords, the majority of their income comes from referrals.
<h3><strong>2. Allow reviews and testimonies to speak for themselves.</strong></h3>
Companies who claim to be experts in SEO but lack reviews, references, and data to back it up should be disregarded. Top-performing SEO agencies will have a slew of testimonials, reviews, and data to back up their claims. These are the SEO firms you should add to your shortlist.
<h3><strong>3. Read their case studies</strong></h3>
Working with an SEO service provider is usually emphasized in reviews and testimonials. However, you should also make certain that they include case studies demonstrating the complexities of their accomplishment. Case studies are useful since they get right to the point and show whether or not an SEO agency can deliver on their promises. You can rapidly identify strengths and problems by reviewing a company's case studies (which they should have). Results, as they say, speak louder than words.
<h3><strong>4. See if they specialize in anything</strong></h3>
As appealing as it may appear to go with a company that does everything, you may find that your money is better spent on an agency that specializes in a specific industry or service. Trying to be the greatest at everything SEO is a huge order that few can fulfill. Investigate the service providers you're considering to discover if they have knowledge in your niche, sector, or issue areas.
<h3><strong>5. Look for an educational provider</strong></h3>
A decent SEO service will do the legwork for you. But a great SEO service will keep you updated and educate you along the process. You will not only have peace of mind knowing that your money is being well-spent, but you will also obtain information and potentially even tools to carry out SEO operations on your own and make informed decisions in the future.
<h3><strong>6. Know your budget</strong></h3>
Knowing your SEO budget can help you decide which providers to eliminate and which to investigate further. Not only will this put you at ease once things get going, but you won't have to worry about any unpleasant cashflow concerns midway through their service plan. Don't be afraid to openly research all of your SEO services provider's payment options.
<h3><strong>7. Get personal with a consultation</strong></h3>
Nothing beats a personal consultation for learning more about an <a href=""https://seofreelancergurgaon.com/""><strong>SEO agency</strong></a>. This allows you to get a true sense of how they conduct business and decide whether or not there is any chemistry. This brings us to the following section.
<h2>Questions to ask during a consultation for SEO service</h2>
Because of past experiences, many small business owners are skeptical of SEO services. They had previously employed so-called SEO professionals who were either just briefly effective, utterly ineffective, or even impacted their website traffic. When researching SEO service providers, beware organizations that advertise assured rankings and automatic link exchange. In addition, ask the following questions:
<ul>
 	<li>How and how frequently will we communicate?</li>
 	<li>Do you have any contracts, budgets, or service options?</li>
 	<li>What is your strategy for improving our rankings?</li>
 	<li>Have you previously worked with a company comparable to ours?</li>
 	<li>How well do you know our industry?</li>
 	<li>What kind of outcomes should we anticipate?</li>
 	<li>What constitutes contract cancellation?</li>
 	<li>What tools do you employ?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Does your small business need SEO services?</h3>
As the world of online marketing evolves, so will the competitive landscape, making SEO more critical than ever. Finally, aside from the price of a website, SEO is free, BUT there are no shortcuts. It is a collection of initiatives that, when combined, will boost your ranking and visibility over time. If you are unsure about your ability to continuously produce relevant and quality content. Properly place keywords into meta data for your websites. Or make other technical changes to your website, an SEO specialist may be the best option for you.","how-do-you-choose-the-best-seo-services-for-your-small-business",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,True,True,NULL

<h2><b>Strategies For Raising Capital:Understanding the Different Funding Sources</b></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Before we guide you about the strategies for raising capital, it's important to know the difference between private equity, venture capital, and other funding sources. Each has its unique characteristics and target businesses:</span>
<h3><b>Private Equity (PE)</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Private equity (PE) involves acquiring an ownership or stake in an entity that is not publicly traded. Typically, this involves high net worth individuals and companies buying shares of privately owned companies. They might also gain control of publicly traded companies, possibly converting the public company into private ownership. </span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">The primary objective is to invest in businesses that demonstrate promising growth potential, using private equity investments to revive or scale up operations. After this, the business can be sold at a profit.</span>
<h3><b>Venture Capital (VC)</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Venture capital provides funding in exchange for equity, actively participating in strategic decisions to nurture the growth of the business. VCs are specifically geared towards startups and early-stage companies with high growth potential.</span>
<h3><b>Angel Investors</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Angel investors are basically those individuals who invest their personal funds in startups and emerging businesses. They often contribute not just capital but also their expertise and industry connections.</span>
<h3><b>Crowdfunding:</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the most popular ways businesses can raise capital is from a large number of individuals who contribute varying amounts. In return, backers may receive products, services, or rewards. With the rapid rise in technology, many crowdfunding platforms have emerged that assist startups in raising funds.</span>
<h3><b>Debt Financing</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Debt financing involves borrowing money from lenders, typically banks or financial institutions, and promising to repay the principal amount along with interest over a specified period.</span>
<h2><b>Strategies for Raising Capital Though Various Funding Sources</b></h2>
<h3><b>Create a Compelling Business Plan</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Before you approach any potential investor, make a solid business plan. Your business plan must have your value proposition, target market, revenue model, and growth strategy. A well-structured business plan demonstrates your commitment and clarity to potential investors.</span>
<h3><b>Build a Strong Network</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Networking is a powerful tool in the business world. Make the most of it by attending industry events, seminars, and workshops to connect with potential investors, mentors, and collaborators. The right connection can open doors to funding opportunities.</span>
<h3><b>Pitch Perfectly</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Your pitch is your chance to shine. So it would be great if you create a concise, compelling pitch highlighting your business's uniqueness, the problem it solves, and the market opportunity. It would be beneficial to customize your pitch to the specific interests of the investor.</span>
<h3><b>Demonstrate Traction</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Investors want to see evidence that your business is gaining traction. So to build trust, provide them with metrics like customer acquisition, revenue growth, and user engagement to showcase your potential.</span>
<h3><b>Understand Investor Preferences</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Always remember that different investors have different preferences and risk appetites. So research is a must for potential investors to understand their focus areas, past investments, and approach. This will help you tailor your pitch to align with their interests.</span>
<h3><b>Due Diligence Preparation</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Did you know that investors conduct thorough due diligence before committing funds? It would benefit you to have your financials, legal documents, and business projections well-prepared and organized for this stage.</span>
<h3><b>Proper Valuation </b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Balancing a realistic valuation with investor expectations is very important. Overvaluing your company can deter investors while undervaluing it could impact your future stake.</span>
<h3><b>Showcase Your Team</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Investors not only invest in the idea but also in the team behind it. So to build confidence, highlight the expertise and track record of your team members. </span>
<h3><b>Flexibility in Deal Structures</b></h3>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Always be open to different deal structures and terms. Some investors may prefer convertible notes, equity investments, or other creative arrangements.</span>

 	<li><b> Cost:</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Monthly rental fees can add up over time, potentially making self-storage an expensive option for long-term storage.</span></li>
 	<li><b> Accessibility:</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> While self-storage facilities are convenient, you may need to plan your trips to access your belongings during operating hours.</span></li>
 	<li><b> Warehousing</b></li>
</ol>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Warehousing is typically associated with businesses that require extensive storage space for their inventory, equipment, or products. Warehouses can be owned or operated by the business itself, or they can be third-party facilities that offer storage services to multiple clients.</span>
<h2><b>Pros of Warehousing</b></h2>
<ol>
 	<li><b> Ample Space:</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Warehouses provide large storage areas, ideal for businesses with substantial storage needs.</span></li>
 	<li><b> Customization: </b><span style=""font-weight: 400;"">You can customize the storage space to meet your specific requirements, making it a highly adaptable option.</span></li>
 	<li><b> Cost-Effective for Businesses:</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> For businesses with significant storage needs, warehousing can be more cost-effective than self-storage over the long term.</span></li>

 	<li><b> Portable Storage</b></li>
</ol>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">Portable storage is an innovative solution that offers the best of both worlds. It provides the convenience of self-storage with the flexibility of warehousing. Portable storage companies deliver storage containers to your location, allowing you to load them at your own pace.</span>

<h2><b>Cons of Portable Storage</b></h2>

Whether you're selling through Amazon, Flipkart, Blinkit, or your website, multi-state GST registration is crucial for scale, compliance, and faster delivery. But managing physical offices in every state is time-consuming, expensive, and logistically complex. That’s where a <a href=""https://thegstco.com/collections/virtualoffice"">virtual office</a> for GST registration comes into play—particularly when facilitated through a government-compliant platform like TheGSTCo.

If you’re looking to expand operations in <strong>Maharashtra, Delhi, Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, Gujarat, Punjab, Rajasthan, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh, Madhya Pradesh</strong>, and <strong>West Bengal</strong>, this blog explains how virtual offices can simplify your GST registration without violating any regulations.

&nbsp;
<h3 class=""western"">What's a Virtual Office for GST Registration?</h3>
A <b>virtual office</b> is a legal arrangement where a business uses an address in a state without operating a physical office there. For the purposes of <strong>GST registration</strong>, this address is listed as either the <strong>Principal Place of Business (PPOB)</strong> or <strong>Additional Place of Business (APOB)</strong> on your GST application.

It enables sellers to get a GSTIN in that state, store inventory in fulfillment centers (like Amazon FCs or Flipkart warehouses), and legally comply with the Central Goods and Services Tax Act, 2017.

When managed through a verified provider and backed by rent agreements, utility proofs, and compliance documentation, a virtual office is 100% legal for GST registration.
<h3 class=""western"">Why is GST registered in multiple states?</h3>
Under GST law, a business must obtain a <strong>separate GSTIN for every state</strong> from which it intends to supply goods or services. If you’re participating in FBA (Fulfilled by Amazon), Smart Fulfillment (Flipkart), or quick commerce models like Blinkit or Zepto, you are effectively supplying from those states' fulfillment centers.

This creates a legal requirement to register GST in each of those locations—even if you do not have a physical office there.
<h3 class=""western"">Why Choose a Virtual Office Over a Physical One?</h3>
Maintaining physical offices in all operational states is costly. You’ll incur:
<ul>
 	<li>Rent and deposit</li>
 	<li>Staffing expenses</li>
 	<li>Utility bills</li>
 	<li>Ongoing management costs</li>
</ul>
A virtual office offers all the compliance benefits without the operational burden.

Benefits include:
<ul>
 	<li>Legal documentation for GST registration</li>
 	<li>Cost savings up to 90%</li>
 	<li>No need for physical presence or employees</li>
 	<li>Use of address for GST, courier communication, and tax filings</li>
 	<li>Fully compliant with GST Rules, Rule 8(1), and Circular 20/16/04/2019-GST</li>
</ul>

But many sellers fail to recognize at an early stage that adhering to the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime is the cornerstone of a seamless expansion, especially when operations span more than one state. Here, multi-state virtual principal place of business (VPOB) solutions become a revolutionary approach to compliance.

Understanding how VPOB and APOB (Additional Place of Business) operate under GST law is essential, regardless of whether you want to start in Maharashtra or need to obtain VPOB in Karnataka.

&nbsp;

<b>The Meaning of a VPOB and Its Significance</b>

Virtual Principal Place of Business is referred to as VPOB. This virtual office provider's registered address satisfies the legal requirements for a principal place of business under GST. Because VPOB solutions eliminate the need for the seller to have a physical presence, they are more affordable and operationally flexible than physical offices.

As part of their<a href=""https://thegstco.com/collections/virtualoffice""> virtual office</a> GST registration procedure, sellers must obtain VPOB in Karnataka when expanding to states like that. They cannot lawfully conduct business, store, or ship products from that state without it.

<b>The Issue of Single-State Operations and GST Compliance</b>

The majority of sellers start off with a single home state GST registration. Leading online retailers such as Amazon, Flipkart, and Blinkit, however, require state-level GST registrations for fulfillment centers or warehouses located in other states.

For instance, you must register for GST in Karnataka if you are a seller from Mumbai and wish to keep goods in a Flipkart warehouse in Bengaluru. Getting a VPOB in Karnataka from a reputable virtual office provider is the best way to accomplish this without opening an expensive office.

&nbsp;

<b>Multi-State VPOB's Advantages for Online Retailers</b>

<b>1. A legitimate business presence without a physical office</b>

By using VPOB, you can lawfully register your company in a new state without having to pay for a physical office. It contains all of the compliance paperwork that the GST Department requires, such as utility proofs, rent agreements, and NOCs.

This arrangement enables you to register and ship from state warehouses such as Amazon FC BLR8 or Flipkart's South Zone hubs without incurring physical setup costs if you're targeting Southern India and want to obtain VPOB in Karnataka.

<b>2. Fast GST Approval and Onboarding in the Marketplace</b>

In an attempt to meet demand, marketplace sellers frequently rush to launch in several states. You can submit APOB amendments, expedite your GST registration, and begin listing your products state-by-state by using a VPOB.

The ability to obtain VPOB in Karnataka guarantees that your company doesn't lose time in scaling, particularly in states with high order volumes like Karnataka.

<b>3. Economical Effectiveness</b>

A VPOB setup is far less expensive than renting office space and employing local employees. In order to lessen your operational burden, packages typically include documentation for post-GST approval, compliance support, and rent agreements.

<b>The Reasons Single-State Sellers Miss Out on Development</b>

The GST regime is straightforward: each location from which goods are shipped or stored needs to be listed under the applicable state GSTIN as either a Principal or Additional Place of Business.

Non-compliance results when a seller uses several warehouses throughout India but only operates under one GSTIN. There could be fines, registration cancellation, or rejection of the input tax credit (ITC).

These risks can be avoided, and compliance never becomes a bottleneck by having access to multiple VPOBs, particularly in strategic areas like Karnataka, Delhi, Maharashtra, and Gujarat.

<b>The Legal Foundation of APOB and VPOB in GST</b>

A location where business is typically conducted, where goods are stored, or where records are kept are all considered ""places of business"" under Section 2(85) of the CGST Act.

You can legally create such a ""place of business"" in Karnataka by obtaining VPOB without actually owning or leasing a commercial property.

Furthermore, proof of address for the PPOB (Principal Place of Business) is required by Rule 18 of the CGST Rules. From electricity bills to rental agreements, a VPOB provider makes sure all paperwork is appropriate and compliant with GST regulations.

<b>Actual Use Case: Karnataka Sellers' Reasons for Selecting VPOB</b>

Large Amazon and Flipkart fulfillment centers are located in Karnataka. You must list Karnataka warehouses as your APOB under GST if you wish to take part in Prime or Express delivery programs.However, a principal place of business must be included in your Karnataka GST application first. Sellers choose to obtain VPOB in Karnataka from reliable providers like TheGSTCo in order to comply without owning a commercial property. In addition to cutting down on time-to-market, this guarantees that you won't lose sales while awaiting documentation. How the GSTCo Makes the Multi-State VPOB Process Easier

&nbsp;

In several Indian states, TheGSTCo offers a VPOB + APOB package that is legally acceptable. An 11-month registered rent agreement, a utility bill or NOC, GST PPOB registration, APOB amendment filing, and authorized signatory support are usually included in each package.

• Desk Assignment (according to rules)

• Lifetime Post-GST Assistance

For sellers wishing to obtain VPOB in Karnataka and other high-demand states in order to quickly onboard on Blinkit, Jiomart, Amazon, or Flipkart, this configuration is perfect.

Multi-State VPOB Setup Challenge Overcomes Obstacles

The Way VPOB Addresses It

The GST department accepts virtual addresses, but a physical office is necessary.

Establishing a State Office Cost

much lower one-time VPOB fee

Postponement of GST Registration

Approval is accelerated by pre-drafted documents.

Registration Delays in Marketplaces

VPOB+APOB completes FBA/FBF onboarding compliance.

Communication Following GST

Committed document mailing and provider support

<b>Is Using a VPOB for GST Registration Legal?</b>

Sure, as long as

1. This address is real.

2. The NOC, utility bills, and rental agreement are all legitimate and verifiable.

3. A representative of the business is present on the property, even if they are assigned virtually.

Therefore, it is essential to select a provider who is approved by GST departments and has a history of successful registrations to obtain VPOB in Karnataka or any other state.

<b>In conclusion,</b>

The path from a small, home-grown company to a national brand is fraught with regulatory responsibilities for rapidly growing e-commerce vendors. One of the most important and challenging responsibilities is registering for GST in multiple states.

Sellers can maintain compliance, lower operating expenses, and grow easily throughout India by implementing a multi-state VPOB strategy. Your first step should be to obtain VPOB in Karnataka or your target state through a verified compliance partner, regardless of whether your plan is to enter the South through Karnataka or to enter North India through Delhi and Haryana.

GST compliance can now serve as a springboard for national success with the correct assistance and legal framework.","why-ecommerce-sellers-smooth-gst-compliance-depends-on-multi-state-vpob",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,True,True,NULL

It’s a comfort enhancer, a pleasure booster, and sometimes a must-have for safer, more satisfying intimacy. But not all lubes are made equal, and how you use them matters just as much as whether you use them at all.

Let’s break down the <strong>do’s and don’ts</strong> of using lube, so you can glide into a better experience—pun fully intended.

<hr />

<h2><strong>Why Use Lube in the First Place?</strong></h2>
Even though your body might naturally lubricate, sometimes that’s not enough—especially with hormonal changes, stress, medications, or certain types of sex like anal play. Lube:
<ul>
 	<li>Reduces friction</li>
 	<li>Prevents irritation</li>
 	<li>Enhances pleasure</li>
 	<li>Makes condom use more comfortable</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2><strong>The Different Types of Lube (And What They’re Good For)</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Water-Based Lube</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Best for: General use, toys, latex condoms</li>
 	<li>Pros: Easy to clean, lightweight</li>
 	<li>Cons: Dries out faster, may need reapplying</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Silicone-Based Lube</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Best for: Shower sex, long-lasting sessions</li>
 	<li>Pros: Ultra-slick, long-lasting</li>
 	<li>Cons: Can damage silicone toys, tougher to wash off</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Oil-Based Lube</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Best for: Massage play or solo use</li>
 	<li>Pros: Natural feel, long glide</li>
 	<li>Cons: Not latex-safe, can cause infections if used vaginally</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Hybrid Lube</strong></h3>
<ul>
 	<li>Best of both worlds: combines water and silicone</li>
 	<li>Pros: Silky feel, partially toy-safe</li>
 	<li>Cons: May still react with certain materials</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2><strong>The Do’s of Using Lube</strong></h2>
<h3>✅ <strong>Do Pick the Right Type for the Job</strong></h3>
Going solo with a toy? Go water-based. Planning shower fun? Silicone’s your bestie. The activity determines the best formula.
<h3>✅ <strong>Do Read the Ingredients</strong></h3>
If you have sensitive skin, avoid lubes with glycerin, parabens, or artificial scents. Look for labels that say “hypoallergenic” or “natural.”
<h3>✅ <strong>Do Use Lube With Condoms (The Right Kind!)</strong></h3>
Use water- or silicone-based lubes with condoms. Oil-based ones can weaken latex and cause breakage.
<h3>✅ <strong>Do Apply Generously</strong></h3>
Don’t be shy! A good amount helps reduce friction and prevents discomfort. Reapply if it starts drying out.
<h3>✅ <strong>Do Patch Test First If You’re Sensitive</strong></h3>
Just like skincare, do a patch test to see how your skin reacts—especially if you’ve had irritation before.
<h3>✅ <strong>Do Experiment with Temperature Play</strong></h3>
Warming lubes or chilling them slightly can add a fun sensory twist. Just test on your skin first.

<hr />

<h2><strong>The Don’ts of Using Lube</strong></h2>
<h3>❌ <strong>Don’t Use Oil-Based Lube With Latex Condoms</strong></h3>
This is rule number one. Oil + latex = breakage risk.
<h3>❌ <strong>Don’t Ignore Unusual Reactions</strong></h3>
If it burns, itches, or feels uncomfortable—stop using it. Your body is giving you clear feedback.
<h3>❌ <strong>Don’t Double-Dip Fingers into the Bottle</strong></h3>
Avoid bacteria contamination. Use clean hands or pump dispensers to keep it fresh.
<h3>❌ <strong>Don’t Use Flavored Lube for Internal Use (Unless It's Safe)</strong></h3>
Not all flavored lubes are made for vaginal or anal penetration. Check the label for where it's safe to use.
<h3>❌ <strong>Don’t Use Expired Lube</strong></h3>
Yes, lube expires. Check the bottle—old lube can harbor bacteria or lose its slickness.

<hr />

<h2><strong>How to Apply Lube Like a Pro</strong></h2>
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Start with Clean Hands</strong></li>
 	<li><strong>Warm it Up (Optional)</strong> – Rub it between your fingers or palms first.</li>
 	<li><strong>Apply to the Right Spots</strong> – Genitals, toys, or condoms.</li>
 	<li><strong>Don’t Forget Your Partner</strong> – Make it a shared experience.</li>
 	<li><strong>Reapply When Needed</strong> – There’s no such thing as too much lube.</li>
</ol>

<hr />

<h2><strong>Using Lube with Sex Toys</strong></h2>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Toy Material Matters</strong>: Silicone toys should <em>not</em> be used with silicone lube.</li>
 	<li><strong>Use Water-Based for Easy Clean-Up</strong>: Especially good if you’re switching between different toys or partners.</li>
 	<li><strong>Don’t Skip Cleaning</strong>: Wash toys before and after to avoid bacterial build-up.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2><strong>Lube for Anal Play: What to Know</strong></h2>
The anus doesn’t self-lubricate. You <em>must</em> use a good amount of lube for anal sex. Silicone lubes are best here, as they don’t dry out quickly.

<hr />

<h2><strong>Lube for Vaginal Dryness or Menopause</strong></h2>
For those experiencing vaginal dryness, lube can be a game-changer. Choose one:
<ul>
 	<li>With aloe vera</li>
 	<li>pH balanced</li>
 	<li>Glycerin-free</li>
</ul>
Talk to your doctor if dryness is persistent—lube can help, but you may also need additional support.

<hr />

<h2><strong>Cleaning Up After Lube</strong></h2>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Water-Based</strong>: Washes off with water—simple!</li>
 	<li><strong>Silicone-Based</strong>: Needs soap and water to remove completely.</li>
 	<li><strong>Oil-Based</strong>: Might stain fabrics, so use with caution.</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2><strong>Natural &amp; Organic Lubes</strong></h2>
Looking for something clean and eco-friendly? Look for:
<ul>
 	<li>Aloe vera-based lubes</li>
 	<li>Coconut oil (only with non-latex condoms!)</li>
 	<li>Products labeled as organic and glycerin-free</li>
</ul>
Avoid anything that smells like perfume—fragrance often = irritation.

<hr />

<h2><strong>Storage &amp; Shelf Life Tips</strong></h2>
<ul>
 	<li>Keep lube in a cool, dry place</li>
 	<li>Avoid direct sunlight</li>
 	<li>Always check the expiration date</li>
 	<li>Seal tightly to avoid contamination</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2><strong>When to See a Doctor</strong></h2>
If you’re experiencing:
<ul>
 	<li>Burning during sex</li>
 	<li>Chronic dryness</li>
 	<li>Unusual discharge</li>
 	<li>Recurring UTIs or infections</li>
</ul>
…it’s time to get checked out. Lube can help, but some issues require medical advice.

<hr />

<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2>
Lube isn't just a bedroom extra—it’s a total game-changer for comfort, safety, and pleasure. Whether you're exploring solo, with a partner, or using toys, knowing how to use lube properly makes the experience smoother in every way.

So, <strong>read the label, choose the right type, and never underestimate the power of a good slip!</strong> The right lube can turn a good time into an unforgettable one.

<hr />

<h2><strong>FAQs</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>1. Can I use spit as lube?</strong></h3>
Technically, yes—but it dries quickly and doesn’t reduce friction well. It can also introduce bacteria.
<h3><strong>2. Is coconut oil safe to use as lube?</strong></h3>
Yes, but not with latex condoms. It’s great for massage or solo play, but can disrupt vaginal pH for some people.
<h3><strong>3. Can I use lube daily?</strong></h3>
Yes, especially for vaginal dryness or to make daily intimacy more comfortable. Choose a gentle, skin-safe lube.
<h3><strong>4. Is it normal for lube to sting?</strong></h3>
Nope! If it stings, it might contain irritants. Switch to a gentler or natural formula.
<h3><strong>5. Where should I store my lube?</strong></h3>
In a cool, dry place away from sunlight. Avoid leaving it in hot bathrooms or cars

<h2 class=""mb-2 mt-4 text-base font-[475] first:mt-0 dark:font-[450]"">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</h2>
<p class=""my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2""><strong>Q1: How does a free AI music generator work?</strong>
An <strong>AI music generator</strong> uses machine learning algorithms trained on vast datasets of music. It learns patterns, melodies, chord progressions, and rhythms. When you provide a prompt (like a genre, mood, or text), the AI uses this knowledge to compose a new, original piece of music that matches your criteria.</p>
<p class=""my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2""><strong>Q2: Is music from a free AI music generator truly copyright-free?</strong>
This is crucial. The licensing terms vary by platform. Most <strong>AI music generator free</strong> tools allow you to use the music in your personal or commercial projects, but often require you to give attribution (credit the tool). Always read the terms of service for each platform before publishing your content to ensure you comply with their policies.</p>
<p class=""my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2""><strong>Q3: Can an AI music generator from text create a song with lyrics?</strong>
Yes! Tools like Suno AI are specifically designed for this. You can write your own lyrics or just provide a theme, and the <strong>AI music generator from text</strong> will create both the instrumental track and the AI-generated vocals to sing the lyrics.</p>
<p class=""my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2""><strong>Q4: What are the main limitations of free tools compared to paid ones?</strong>
Typically, free plans have limitations such as a lower number of monthly downloads, limited audio quality (e.g., MP3 instead of WAV), fewer customization features, and stricter licensing terms (like requiring attribution). Paid plans unlock higher quality, more creative control, and often provide full commercial licenses without the need for credit.</p>

Today, it represents freedom, authenticity, and intentionality. Instead of pleasing hundreds of guests, couples focus on what matters most—their love, their vows, and the experience of the day itself.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">With fewer logistics, elopements allow partners to craft a wedding that truly reflects their personalities. Whether that means exchanging vows on a mountaintop, beside a cliff overlooking the ocean, or in a quiet city courtyard, the day becomes about the couple—not the seating chart.</span>
<h2><b>Why Modern Couples Prefer Elopements</b></h2>
<ol>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><b>Less Stress, More Joy</b><b>
</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Planning a traditional wedding often comes with endless checklists, family expectations, and financial strain. Elopements, on the other hand, strip away the stress, giving couples the freedom to focus on the joy of committing to one another.</span>&nbsp;</li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><b>Budget-Friendly Without Losing the Magic</b><b>
</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Many couples realize they’d rather invest in experiences—such as travel or photography—than in a single night of extravagance. An elopement allows for a beautiful, meaningful ceremony without breaking the bank.</span>&nbsp;</li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><b>Intimacy at Its Best</b><b>
</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> For couples who value privacy and connection, an </span><a href=""https://www.twinflameselopements.com/vow-renewals-and-ireland-elopement/""><b>elopement wedding</b></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> creates the perfect atmosphere. Sharing vows in a private setting makes the moment deeply personal and unforgettable.</span>&nbsp;</li>
 	<li style=""font-weight: 400;""><b>Flexibility and Adventure</b><b>
</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> Unlike traditional weddings, elopements offer incredible flexibility. Couples can tie the knot wherever their hearts desire—whether it’s a cozy cabin in the woods, a dramatic coastal cliff, or a picturesque village abroad.</span>&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<h2><b>Capturing the Magic with the Right Photographer</b></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">One of the most important aspects of an elopement is capturing the story. Since the celebration is intimate, the photos often become the way couples share their day with loved ones. Choosing an experienced photographer makes all the difference.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For couples dreaming of saying “I do” amidst Ireland’s dramatic cliffs, rolling hills, and romantic castles, hiring an </span><a href=""https://www.twinflameselopements.com/vow-renewals-and-ireland-elopement/""><b>Elopement Photographer Ireland</b></a><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> from </span><b><i>Twin Flames Elopements</i></b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> ensures every breathtaking moment is preserved. These photographers not only understand the landscapes but also the emotions that make elopements so extraordinary.</span>
<h2><b>The New Dream Wedding</b></h2>
<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">At the heart of it, modern couples crave authenticity and experiences that truly reflect their bond. An </span><b>elopement wedding</b><span style=""font-weight: 400;""> delivers exactly that—a day focused on love, intimacy, and adventure rather than obligations and traditions.</span>

<span style=""font-weight: 400;"">For those who believe that love should be celebrated in its purest form, elopement weddings aren’t just a trend—they’re the new dream.</span>","why-elopement-weddings-are-the-new-dream-for-modern-couples",NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,NULL,True,True,NULL

<p class=""my-2 [&amp;+p]:mt-4 [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:inline-block [&amp;_strong:has(+br)]:pb-2"">Norwegian Cruise Line blends resort-style ships, flexible dining, and big-ticket entertainment with globe-spanning itineraries across the Caribbean, Alaska, Europe, Asia, Hawaii, and beyond.

Whether chasing glaciers, Greek sunsets, or private‑island beach days, NCL’s mix of choice and energy makes it a go‑to for couples, families, and friend groups.</p>
